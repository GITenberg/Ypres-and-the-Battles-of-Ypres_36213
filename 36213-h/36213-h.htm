<h2>YPRES</h2>

<h3>AND THE BATTLES FOR ITS POSSESSION</h3>

<div class="center">FOREWORD</div>


<p>The town of Ypres lies in a sort of natural basin formed by a maritime
plain intersected by canals, and dominated on the north, north-east and
south by low wooded hills.</p>

<p>These canals, of which the Yser Canal is the most important, follow a
general direction south-east&mdash;north-west. A number of streams flowing
in the same direction also water the plain. In addition, there are the
Dickebusch, Zillebeke and Bellewaarde ponds.</p>

<p>The hills forming the sides of this basin are very low and partly wooded.
The line of their crests runs approximately from north to south, through
Houthulst Forest (road from Poelcappelle to Clercken), Poelcappelle,
Passchendaele, Broodseinde, Becelaere, Gheluvelt, the strategic Hill 60
(south of Zillebeke) and St. Eloi. Further south is the Messines-Wytschaete
ridge, and to the south-west the Hills of Flanders.</p>

<p>Houthulst Forest is the largest of the woods. Next come the islets of
Westroosebeke and Passchendaele, then, south of Zonnebeke, Polygone
Wood, Nonne-Bosschen (or Nonnes) Wood, and the Woods of Glencorse,
Inverness and Herenthage.</p>

<p>In this region, with its essentially maritime climate, the war assumed
a character entirely different from that of the rest of the front. The
marshy ground, almost at sea-level, is further sodden by constant rain and
mists, and forms a spongy mass, in which it was impossible to dig trenches
or underground shelters. Water is found immediately below the surface,
so that the only possible defence-works were parapets. The bursting shells
made huge craters which, promptly filling with water, became so many
death-traps for wounded and unwounded alike.</p>

<p>The defence on both sides consequently centred around the woods,
villages, and numerous farms, which were converted into redoubts with
concrete blockhouses and deep wire entanglements. The slightest bits of
rising ground here played an important part, and were fiercely disputed.
The crests which dominate the basin of Ypres were used as observation-posts&mdash;the
lowering sky being usually unfavourable for aerial observation&mdash;while
their counter-slopes masked the concentrations of troops for the attacks.</p>

<p>It was therefore along the line of crests and around the fortified farms
that the fighting reached its maximum of intensity.</p>

<p>The principal military operations which took place in the vicinity of the
town between October, 1914, and November, 1917, may be divided as
follows:&mdash;First, a powerful German offensive&mdash;a counter-stroke to the battles
of the Yser&mdash;then a very definite effort to take the town. The rôle of the
Allied armies was at that time purely defensive.</p>

<p>The second stage was marked by a British and Franco-British offensive,
begun in the second half of 1916 and considerably developed during the
summer and autumn of the following year. The object of these operations,
which ended in November, 1917, was the clearing of Ypres. All the objectives
were attained and the plains of Flanders were opened to the Allies.</p>

<p>A final effort by the Germans in great strength to the south of the town
was checked by the resistance of the Allies in April, 1918. In September
and October, 1918, the enemy troops finally evacuated the country under
pressure of the victorious Allied offensive.</p>

<h2>THE GERMAN OFFENSIVE OF 1914</h2>

<div class="center">(October 29&mdash;November 15, 1914.)</div>


<h3>Preliminary Operations</h3>

<p>After the victory of the Marne, which drove the Germans north of the
Aisne, began the operations known as "the Race to the Sea." Each side
endeavoured to outpace the other, with the object of surrounding the
enemy's marching wing.</p>

<p>This remarkable "Race to the Sea"&mdash;a widely extended movement
splendidly carried out by General Foch, and in which the Allied forces in
their march towards the north constantly outstripped the enemy&mdash;might
have been used as the starting-point for a grand Allied offensive against the
German right, but the exhaustion of the Belgian army, after the terrible
trials which it had just gone through in its retreat on the Yser&mdash;following
on the fall of Antwerp&mdash;and the delays in the transport of the British troops
from the Aisne front to the north, prevented the development of this offensive.</p>

<p>It was therefore only possible for the Allied armies to fix their front and
make it impregnable.</p>

<p>The stages of this race to the sea and the fixation of the front took place
between September 20 and October 23, 1914.</p>


<h3>The Forces Engaged (Oct. 1914)</h3>

<p>When the First Battle of Ypres opened, the front described a wide semi-circle
passing through Zonnebeke, Gheluvelt and Zandvoorde, running
thence south of Messines, and finally linking up with the line to the east of
Armentières.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 701px;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<img src="images/i-007.png" width="701" height="1000" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>At the beginning of the battle all this part of the front was held by the
British army, as follows: from Zonnebeke to Zandvoorde, the 1st Corps
(Haig) and 4th Corps (Rawlinson); from Zandvoorde to Messines, the
Calvary Corps (Allenby), two infantry divisions, and the Lahore Division,
which had just landed at Marseilles; lastly, from Messines to Armentières,
the 3rd Corps (Pulteney).</p>

<p>Facing these forces were the German IVth army, consisting of the XIIIth,
XVth and XVIth active corps, and the IInd Bavarian Corps, reinforced
during the battle by a Division of the Guards. The British Cavalry Corps
had to face four German Cavalry Corps.</p>

<span class="caption">THE GERMAN THRUST OF OCT. 29&mdash;30, 1914 (29&mdash;30/10)</span>
</div>

<p>To make up for their setback in the race to the sea, the German High
Command decided on a strenuous effort to break through the Allies' front
at Ypres. The "Battle for Calais" was about to begin. The enemy confidently
expected to reach the coast, from which they hoped to expose
England to such peril as would break down the pride of that troublesome
enemy.</p>

<p>The German attack began on October 29 under the eye of the Kaiser,
who, for the following five days, took up his quarters at Thielt, whence he
arranged to make a triumphal entry into Ypres.</p>

<p>For seventeen days (October 29&mdash;November 15) the German regiments,
elated by the presence of their Emperor, fought with unheard-of frenzy and
an utter disregard of losses in their frantic attacks against the Ypres salient.</p>

<span class="caption">ON OCT. 31, THE GERMANS MADE PROGRESS, SOUTH OF YPRES, BUT WERE
DRIVEN BACK, EASTWARDS, TO GHELUVELT</span>
</div>

<p>To the east of Ypres the action fought between Poelcappelle and Gheluvelt
failed. The fierce German attacks, in spite of the masses of men engaged,
broke down before the stubborn resistance of the Allies.</p>

<p>In a counter-offensive the British, supported on their left by French
divisions, reached the village of Becelaere, between Zonnebeke and Gheluvelt,
but were unable to hold it.</p>

<p>Further south, the British were forced to abandon Zandvoorde and
Hollebeke. Gheluvelt, first lost on October 30, was recaptured on the 31st
in a counter-attack by the 1st Corps. Supported by three French battalions,
the British subsequently repulsed all attacks and successfully barred the
road from Menin to Ypres. On the evening of the 31st, the line in the eastern
sector ran as follows: east of Frezenberg, Gheluvelt, east of Klein Zillebeke
and the bend in the canal to the north-east of Hollebeke.</p>

<span class="caption">ON NOV. 1, THE SITUATION WAS CRITICAL IN THE EXTREME. THE GERMANS

</div>

<p>The Germans were more successful to the south-east. After an intense
bombardment they attacked, on October 30, from Saint-Yves to Wytschaete,
capturing Saint-Yves and obtaining a footing in Messines, from which, however,
they were immediately driven by a counter-attack.</p>

<p>On October 31, the Germans, after concentrating enormous masses of
troops between Oosttaverne and Roozebeek Canal, made a fresh attack.
In the morning they gained a footing in the eastern outskirts of Messines, but
could get no further, thanks to a counter-attack by three French battalions
with twelve guns from St. Eloi.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, redoubled their efforts, and towards noon, after
a fierce struggle in the streets of Messines, the British cavalry were gradually
forced back, but clung desperately to the western outskirts of the village.
At about 3 p.m. a fierce struggle began for the recapture of the convent to
the south of Messines, then in the enemy's hands. By night the British were
in possession of the last houses west of Messines, the Germans holding the
eastern crest.</p>

<span class="caption">ON NOV. 2, THE FRENCH COUNTER-ATTACKED AND RETOOK THE MESSINES-WYTSCHAETE
RIDGE. THE GERMANS LAUNCHED A MASS ATTACK AGAINST

</div>

<p>During the night of October 31, the Messines-Wytschaete crest was again
fiercely attacked. The Germans gained a footing in Wytschaete and broke
the British line to the north of Messines. A withdrawal became necessary,
and at dawn the line was set back as far as the western outskirts of
Wulverghem.</p>

<p>During the day of November 1, Wytschaete was retaken and lost again.</p>

<p>French Zouaves, acting as reinforcements, held their ground doggedly
in front of St. Eloi. The enemy offensive redoubled in intensity, and the
situation became desperate. As a result of the flooding of the Yser, the
German IIIrd Corps in the northern sector became available and joined in
the assault.</p>

<p>The French 14th Corps, hurriedly called up, counter-attacked furiously
and succeeded in driving back the Germans and gaining a fresh footing in
the western outskirts of Wytschaete. On November 2, the French were
once more in possession of the western crest of Messines-Wytschaete.</p>

<p>This check did not daunt the Germans, who, having just been reinforced
from their Belgian garrisons, directed their efforts further to the north.
The attack was made by compact masses of troops on the St. Eloi-Zwarteleen
front, the movement coinciding with a thrust against Gheluvelt on the
Menin-Ypres Road. At the latter point the front was momentarily broken,
but furious counter-attacks re-established the original positions. The
French troops which held the bend of the canal north-east of Hollebeke were
overpowered and thrown back on Verbranden-Molen. A counter-attack
by the 1st British Corps checked the enemy onrush, and after a magnificent
defence the original line was almost entirely maintained.</p>

<span class="caption">THE GERMANS CONTINUED THEIR FURIOUS ATTACKS UNTIL NOV. 11, BUT
FAILED TO REACH THEIR OBJECTIVE: YPRES</span>
</div>

<p>The battle continued to rage with increasing violence, the culminating
point being reached on November 11. At dawn the Germans, after a terrific
artillery preparation lasting several hours, attacked with the infantry of
the Ist and IVth Brigades of the Prussian Guards. They succeeded in piercing
the line in three places, and forced their way into the woods behind the
trenches to a depth of rather more than two miles through the principal
breach.</p>

<p>They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> did not, however, reach their objective. Enfiladed by machine-gun
fire, they were partly driven back into their trenches, after a bloody hand-to-hand
struggle amid great confusion. The losses on both sides were very
heavy, without any decisive result being attained.</p>

<p>The weather, previously bad, now became a violent storm. During the
night, under cover of the hurricane, the Prussian Guard broke through the
Allies' front. Ypres&mdash;the prize on which the Kaiser had set his heart&mdash;seemed
at last within the enemy's grasp.</p>

<p>But the British, momentarily demoralized, quickly rallied and drove
back the Prussians in a heroic charge.</p>

<p>The struggle continued fiercely during the following days, the Germans
launching numerous attacks with compact masses of troops. The deep lines
of infantry, led by young officers, whose undeniable courage did not
compensate for their lack of experience, were mown down.</p>

<p>Exasperated by this check, the enemy set about to destroy the town
which they were unable to take. On November 10, German aeroplanes
dropped incendiary bombs, and thenceforth the bombardment was conducted
methodically both by aeroplanes and by guns firing from ten to twenty shells
per minute.</p>

<p>Up to the 13th, the town had suffered comparatively little. The Cloth
Hall had only been hit by two shells (on the 5th) and by a few bombs. But
in the disastrous days of October 22, 23 and afterwards, the bombardment
became more intense and better regulated. The Germans brought up an
armoured train to Houthem, which, directed by observation balloons, rained
incendiary and explosive shells on the town. On the evening of the 23rd,
all that remained of the Place des Halles was a heap of ruins.</p>

<h3>Period of Comparative Calm</h3>

<div class="center">(December, 1914&mdash;April, 1915.)</div>


<p>Having failed to pierce the front in the neighbourhood of Ypres, the
Germans abandoned their attacks in close formation, and operations in this
sector were soon limited to incessant artillery actions, occasionally followed
by fierce surprise attacks at isolated points.</p>

<p>Some of the attacks during this period of comparative calm are worthy
of note.</p>

<p>On December 10, the Germans launched three attacks against the British
troops in front of St. Eloi, only one of which gave any result. The enemy
captured the first trenches of the Allies' line, but were driven out on the
following night by a counter-attack.</p>

<p>Other attempts were made during the following week, with the same
negative result.</p>

<p>On December 17, the Germans attacked in force to the north-west of
Ypres. Zonnebeke, Langemarck and Bixschoote were bitterly disputed, and
the two last-named villages remained in the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>These battles were fought in a sea of mud formed by the rain and the
flooding of the land by the Belgians.</p>

<p>One Colonel wrote: "The ground on which we are fighting is awful. There
is a crust about a foot thick which is comparatively good, but underneath
there is bottomless mud. Men standing in trenches four or five feet deep are
almost unable to get out, and gradually sink until it takes several men to
extricate them."</p>

<p>The first fortnight of January was comparatively quiet. During the
second fortnight a strong German attack broke down before the front-line
trenches near Bixschoote.</p>

<p>The continual rains in this previously flooded district rendered all activity
impossible, save that of the artillery, which continued to bombard unceasingly
during February.</p>

<span class="caption">THE FRONT-LINE DURING THE WINTER CAMPAIGN OF 1914&mdash;1915</span>
</div>

<p>It was only in the first half of March that the opposing armies became
really active. From the 5th to 11th, powerful German attacks were repulsed
between Dixmude and the Lys.</p>

<p>The British, on their part, were not inactive during this period. They
fought a vigorous action between the Lys and La Bassée, captured Neuve-Chapelle
after prolonged strenuous fighting, and took a thousand prisoners,
including several officers.</p>

<p>As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> the weather conditions improved, the number of local engagements
increased. In an enemy attack on St. Eloi, between March 12 and 18, the
British first lost and then recaptured that village. Further south, during
the first half of April, fierce engagements were fought without decisive result
in front of the villages of Kemmel and Wulverghem.</p>

<p>The Germans continued to bombard Ypres with large calibre shells,
heaping ruins upon ruins.</p>

<h2>THE SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES</h2>

<div class="center">(April&mdash;May&mdash;June, 1915.)</div>

<p>The long period of enforced inaction during the winter months, and the
depressing waiting in the icy mud, were now succeeded first by local enemy
attacks, then by a fresh powerfully organised attempt by the Germans to
capture Ypres.</p>

<p>The battle began on April 14 with a strong unsuccessful thrust to the north
of Ypres. The British replied by attacking Hill 60.</p>

<p>On April 17, after the firing of a powerful mine, the hill was brilliantly
captured, and in spite of bitter counter-attacks on the 18th by the Germans,
who fully realised the importance of this <i>point d'appui</i>, the position remained
in the hands of the British.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new German offensive was being prepared, which their
High Command believed would prove irresistible, thanks to the use of a new
weapon, as murderous as it was unexpected.</p>

<p>Although Germany had signed the clause of the Hague Convention (July
29, 1899), which prohibits the use of <b>asphyxiating gas</b>, the unscrupulous
leaders now made use for the first time of this treacherous weapon.</p>

<p>In accordance with their usual practice, they claimed that the British
used the gas first, and that they used it only in reprisal. Needless to say,
this assertion was pure fiction.</p>

<p>On April 22 the front ran as follows: Belgian troops held the canal; the
French 45th Colonial Infantry Division, resting on the canal, and passing
through Bixschoote, linked up with the troops of the Canadian 3rd Brigade.</p>

<p>Throughout the morning of April 22, the Germans bombarded the first
lines, while the roads behind were swept by the fire of the heavy artillery,
including 16&frac12;-in. guns. The bombardment continued into the afternoon.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at about 4 p.m., there rose from the German trenches, opposite
the lines occupied by the French Colonial troops, a strange opaque cloud of
greenish-yellow fumes. A light breeze from the north-east wafted this cloud
towards the French, who, a few moments later, fell gasping for breath in
terrible agony. Terror spread through the ranks, especially among the
African troops. A panic inevitably followed, which quickly spread from the
front to the rear lines.</p>

<p>Behind that cloud of gas the German troops advanced, protected by a
heavy barrage and intense machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>The French Colonial troops fell back several miles towards Ypres, and the
Germans took Steenstraat, Het Sas and Pilkem, together with many prisoners.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the French uncovered the left flank of the Canadians,
who were on their right, and they in turn were obliged to fall back, leaving
four guns in the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Canadians, rallying, took the offensive, recovered
part of the lost ground between Steenstraat and Langemarck, together with
their guns, and inflicted a sanguinary defeat on the Germans.</p>

(April 24, 1915.)" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE FIRST GERMAN POISON-GAS ATTACK<br />
(April 24, 1915.)</span>
</div>

<p>Further north, on the Yser Canal, the enemy took advantage of the disorder
caused by the gas to cross at Steenstraat Bridge, and reached the village of
Lizerne near Zuydschoote, where they strongly entrenched themselves.
But Zouaves, aided by Belgians, counter-attacked in force, retook Lizerne,
and advanced along the canal.</p>

<p>The greatest German effort was made on April 25 against the British lines.</p>

<p>The attacking troops had been grouped on both sides of the railway from
Ypres to Roulers, near Broodseinde, but in spite of fierce attacks they could
not break the British lines, and once more their dastardly methods failed them.</p>

<p>At the end of April the front was fixed as follows: from Steenstraat the
line followed the canal as far as Het Sas Bridgehead and then passed along the
right bank to Pilkem (on the opposite bank). Here it turned at right-angles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
eastwards, as far as Soetart Farm (on the Ypres-Langemarck Road), turned
south-east through Wieltje, then west of Hooge, finally linking up with Hill 60
and St. Eloi.</p>

<p>The Germans revenged themselves for their failure by again bombarding
Ypres.</p>

<p>The shelling, which had ceased for a time prior to the offensive, began
again with renewed intensity. An enormous quantity of heavy artillery had
been brought up, and large calibre shells were continuously rained on the
unhappy city, causing a panic. The few remaining inhabitants fled terror-stricken
along the Poperinghe Road.</p>

<p>During the last week of April the battle continued with great bitterness,
but in spite of the enemy's use of gas, the Allies gradually retook the lost
ground. Then followed a fresh period of calm, broken from time to time by
fierce attacks, of which that of May 5 on Hill 60 was the most important.</p>

<p>On May 8 the battle broke out afresh in the region lying between Poelcappelle
and the Ypres-Menin Road. The Germans pierced the British line
at several points, notably between St. Julien and Frezenberg, and reached
Wieltje, but after bitter hand-to-hand fighting, they were driven back to
their trenches at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>The next day the attack was renewed in close formation, under the protection
of an intense bombardment of gas shells, but the British, now provided
with masks, stood firm. The German columns, mown down by shrapnel and
machine-gun fire, were unable to reach the British trenches.</p>

<p>The fighting died down during the next few days, on account of rain and
wind storms, which made all movement impossible, but began again on the
24th without, however, any appreciable advantage for the Germans, who
once more took the offensive.</p>

<p>Another period of calm set in, and this Second Battle of Ypres&mdash;the
second serious check of the Germans before the town&mdash;ended in a successful
operation by the British, who, on June 2, captured the Château of Hooge on
the Menin Road, two miles from Ypres.</p>


<h3>Long period of comparative calm. Isolated actions.<br />
Artillery activity on both sides</h3>

<div class="center">(June, 1915&mdash;June, 1917.)</div>

<p>These weeks of fierce, bloody fighting were followed by a long period of
comparative calm, the operations having been transferred to other parts of
the front (Argonne, Artois, Champagne). Nevertheless, local actions took
place from time to time without any appreciable result. From July 22 to 26
the British, after successful mining operations, advanced their line along the
Ypres-Menin Road, in the neighbourhood of Hooge Château.</p>

<p>After being driven from the outskirts of the château by a gas attack on
August 7, they retook the lost ground on the 8th and advanced beyond it.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of September there was a rather severe bombardment
near Steenstraat and Ramscappelle, while Ypres received 300 more shells.</p>

<p>During the latter half of August an Order of the Day to the German Armies
in Flanders stated: "<i>Our work is practically finished in the East, and we are on
the point of beginning in the West; peace in October is certain.</i>"</p>

<span class="caption">THE FRONT LINE FROM JUNE 1915 TO JUNE 1917</span>
</div>

<p>In December, a new offensive by the Germans failed, despite the use of
gas. There was unusual artillery activity, all the heavy guns, both German
and British, being brought into action.</p>

<p>On December 30, Field-Marshal French received the title of "Viscount
of Ypres," in commemoration of the vigorous British defence of that city.</p>

<p>On February 12, 1916, the Germans launched fresh attacks in the west,
near Steenstraat and Het Sas, and attempted to cross the Yser. After being
smartly checked, they furiously attacked the British trenches between the
Ypres-Comines Canal and the railway, and succeeded in capturing one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
them for a length of 600 yards. This trench, on account of its frequently
changing hands, came to be known as the "International Trench." A few
days later (March 2) the British retook it.</p>

<p>The struggle now became limited to a continuous artillery duel, with
occasional surprise infantry attacks. The hamlet of St. Eloi to the south
was the scene of constant fighting for the possession of the shell-craters.</p>

<p>On April 19, the fighting assumed a more serious character. An unimportant
German attack near St. Eloi and along the Ypres-Langemarck
Road was the prelude to operations by considerable enemy forces, having
for their objective the great undulating slopes between Hill 60 and
Armentières.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<span class="caption">BRITISH DEFENCE WORKS IN FRONT OF YPRES</span>
</div>

<p>The first of these attacks took place on April 25, 1916, but failed. Two
days later a night attack with gas was repulsed with hand grenades.</p>

<p>A third attempt was made in May, 1916, more to the south towards
Armentières, on the sides of the road connecting that town with Ypres.
The British, entrenched in a wood near Ploegsteert Village, were assailed by
three German columns, and were only able to repulse two of them. The
third took the position, but Scottish troops counter-attacked and drove the
Germans back.</p>

<p>The most important of the enemy attacks during this period took place
on June 1. The preparations included a concentration of troops between
Tournai and Baisieux, from May 21 to 27, supported by guns of all calibres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The attack was carried out in considerable strength between Hooge and the
Ypres-Comines Railway.</p>

<p>The artillery preparation began at 9.15 a.m. on June 1, and at noon the
first assaulting wave entered the front-line trenches. The battle died down
for a few minutes in the evening, only to break out again during the night.
The Germans succeeded in crushing in the front to a depth of some 700 yards
in the direction of Zillebeke, but the next day a portion of the lost ground
was retaken by the Canadians.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<span class="caption">THE FLANDERS BATTLEFIELD IN WINTER</span>
</div>

<p>On June 6, a fresh assault began, preceded by the usual bombardment,
and further assisted by mine explosions. The front line trenches to the
north of Hooge were lost; but on the 13th the valiant Canadians, who had
previously recaptured the original positions abandoned on June 1, resumed
the offensive, and re-established the lines from the southern part of Sanctuary
Wood to a point 1,000 yards north of Hill 60.</p>

<p>Throughout the days of June 26 and 28 there was an extremely violent
bombardment, to which the British guns replied effectively. The Germans,
whose losses from the attacks and this artillery fire were very heavy, declared:
"<i>Belgium will be our grave.</i>"</p>

<p>These were the last operations in which the enemy took the offensive.
All their efforts had failed, whether their object had been to turn the left
flank of the Allies, to break the lines around Ypres, or merely to take the town.</p>

<h2>THE ALLIED OFFENSIVE OF 1917</h2>

<p><i>Series of powerful attacks with limited objectives. From June to October,
the stages of the offensive were punctuated by breathing spaces, during which
the conquered ground was consolidated, in view of counter-attacks, and the
artillery brought up, to prepare the following attack.</i></p>


<h3>Preliminary Operations</h3>

<h3>The Capture of Messines Ridge by the British</h3>

<div class="center">(June 7, 1917.)</div>


<p>From July, 1916, to May, 1917, the Ypres sector remained comparatively
quiet. There were few attacks on either side, but the guns thundered day
and night. It may be said that the British were "trying their hand."</p>

<p>In June, 1917, certain at last of their strength, they made their first big
effort, and step by step, in accordance with a carefully worked-out plan,
they completely liberated Ypres by a series of offensives lasting four months,
and broke the iron circle which, for two years, had been strangling the
town.</p>

<p>For several months before the battle, the attack on Messines Ridge had
been carefully planned by means of a model in relief, situated in the open
air and covering an area about equal to that of a tennis court. Here were
reproduced in relief all the contours and peculiarities of the ground. Everything,
down to an isolated tree trunk, was reproduced.</p>

<p>British effort took definite shape for the first time on June 7. The attack,
planned by Sir Douglas Haig, had for its objective the capture of the crests
between Wytschaete and Messines, which the Germans had seized on
November 1, 1914.</p>

<p>For seven days an artillery preparation of incredible intensity hammered
the villages of Messines and Wytschaete, until they had completely disappeared.</p>

<p>On June 7, about an hour before dawn, at 3.10 a.m., the sky was lit up
by an intense light, while a series of terrific explosions were heard; nineteen
mines, some of whose galleries had taken more than a year to bore, exploded
along the enemy positions.</p>

<p>The Germans were taken completely by surprise, and gave way before the
impetuous onrush. In a few minutes their first line was carried along the
whole of the attacked front. Then, almost without a pause, the British troops
attacked the western slopes of the Messines-Wytschaete Ridge, and by about
6.30 a.m. held the crests along the whole line.</p>

<p>The village of Messines offered resistance, but was captured by the New
Zealanders in a vigorous attack, as was also the village of Wytschaete. By
noon the second stage of the offensive was about to begin.</p>

<p>Descending the eastern slopes of the ridge the British carried a second
strong position, then attacked a fresh line&mdash;chiefly in Rayon Wood&mdash;in
which were large shelters of reinforced concrete, each capable of holding a
company. At about 4 p.m. Oosttaverne Village, lying west of the centre
of the position, fell. At sun-down the day's objectives had been completely
attained, and the advance at certain points exceeded two miles in
depth.</p>

<p>This fine success was due to the carefully detailed preparation carried
out under the orders of General Herbert Plumer, to the destructive effect of
the mines, to the violence and precision of the bombardment, to the excellent
co-operation of the Air Forces, and to the harmonious working together of
all arms. The tanks rendered excellent service.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BRITISH OFFENSIVE OF JUNE 7, 1917, AGAINST MESSINES RIDGE,

</div>

<p>The Germans made an effort to rally, but their first counter-attacks, near
Oosttaverne and to the east of Messines, failed.</p>

<p>At about 7 p.m., on June 8, a fresh German counter-attack was launched
along the whole of the new front between St. Yvon and the Ypres-Comines
Canal. Other engagements were fought to the east of Messines and near
Klein Zillebeke. Although reinforced by fresh divisions, the German attack
was broken by midnight.</p>

<p>Resuming their offensive, the British, on the morning of June 11, captured
the whole system of German trenches, nearly a mile in length, situated near
Poterie Farm, to the south-east of Messines. The next day fresh progress
was made along nearly two miles of the front to the north-east of Messines,
and the hamlet of Gapaard occupied.</p>

</div>

<p>After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> the offensive&mdash;limited in scope&mdash;of June 7, which reduced the salient,
south of Ypres, the British continued to press the enemy. Frequent raids
kept the Germans on the alert and secured important <i>points d'appui</i>.</p>

<p>On June 14, the Germans were forced to abandon an important part
of their first-line trenches between the Lys and St. Yvon. On the same day
a considerable advance was made east of Ploegsteert Wood, and in the
immediate neighbourhood of Gapaard Village.</p>

<p>During the night of the 14th a double attack was made: one to the east
of Messines; the other along both banks of the Ypres-Comines Canal, to
the north-west of Hollebeke. These attacks gave the British a large number
of trenches, which they held in spite of fierce counter-attacks.</p>

<p>To sum up, during the latter half of June an advance of 500 to 1,000 yards
in depth was made along the whole front line between Klein Zillebeke and the
Lys.</p>

<p>The month of July passed in raids, patrols, and reconnoitring, preparatory
to the new offensive of July 31.</p>

<p>This far-reaching offensive, which lasted from July 31 to the end of October,
may be divided into six successive phases, and ended with the liberation of
Ypres.</p>


<h3>First Phase</h3>

<div class="center">(July 31&mdash;August 15.)</div>

<h3>Capture of the First and Second German Lines</h3>


<p>When the battle began, the firing line extended from Dixmude, along the
Yser Canal, then followed the Yperlée River, on the left bank of the Yser
Canal. It next passed through Lizerne to Het Sas, whence it followed the
canal to Boesinghe. Opposite this village the line crossed the canal and the
Ypres-Bruges railway, then passed the Quatre-Chemins cross-roads, descending
thence to Essenfarm and Kruppfarm, which lie on either side of the
Pilkem Road. Continuing west of Wieltje Village, it passed south of Verlorenhoek
Château, skirted Verlorenhoek Village, and descended west of Hooge,
after crossing the Ypres-Roulers railway. It next skirted the northern part
of Sanctuaire Wood, then entered the latter, coming out to the south of
Zwateleen. From there, the line extended southwards, passing west of
Hollebeke, east of Gapaard, and skirting the eastern fringe of Ploegsteert
Wood.</p>

<p>During the fortnight preceding the offensive, changes were made in the
order of the forces holding the line.</p>

<p>British troops relieved the Belgians and French who had been operating
near the coast, in the direction of Lombaertzyde. Moreover, the French
forces, placed at the disposal of General Anthoine, had taken up positions
between the Belgians and the British from Reninghe to Elverdinghe.</p>

<span class="caption">FIRST STAGE OF THE ALLIES&#39; ADVANCE FROM JULY 31 TO AUGUST 11, 1917
<br />
(31/7&mdash;11/8)</span>
</div>

<p>At 4 a.m.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> on July 31, in spite of unfavourable weather, the British troops,
under the command of Generals Plumer and Gough, co-operating with the
Franco-Belgian troops led by General Anthoine, attacked in force along a
front of fourteen miles from Dixmude to the Lys.</p>

<p>In the French sector, the greater part of the troops had crossed the Yser
during the night. The artillery then pounded the first and second German
lines, and as soon as the range had been lengthened, the infantry dashed
forward. At the scheduled hour the first and second enemy lines from Dixmude
to Bixschoote, to a depth in places of almost two miles, were occupied, while
Bixschoote, Steenstraat, and Kortekeer Inn fell.</p>

<p>The British were on the right of the French. The Ypres-Roulers Road
formed the axis on which their attack turned. On the left of this road
they pierced the German lines to a depth of nearly two miles, and occupied
the bridges over the Steenbeek Canal. Several villages were captured:
Verlorenhoek, Frezenberg, St. Julien, Pilkem, in addition to a large number
of fortified farms and woods.</p>

<p>On the right of the Ypres-Roulers Road, the British encountered a very
strong resistance. The ground, more broken than that on the other part
of the battle-front, and also intersected with woods, enabled the Germans to
keep several <i>points d'appui</i>. Despite the fiercest fighting, it was impossible
to drive them out of part of the second position on the right wing. Nevertheless,
an advance of about a mile in depth was made in this sector, and the
village of Hooge and Sanctuary Wood were captured.</p>

<p>On their extreme right the British had captured Hollebeke Village early
that morning.</p>

<p>The next day (August 1), the Germans replied but feebly in the French
sector, while in the British sector, in spite of the rain, they counter-attacked
with the greatest fury.</p>

<p>Near St. Julien the line fell back slightly, but along the rest of the front
the positions were fully maintained.</p>

<p>The first phase in the liberation of Ypres was over.</p>

<p>In forty-eight hours, the offensive, methodically prepared and carried out,
had attained the objectives, given the Allies more than 6,000 prisoners and
an immense quantity of stores.</p>

<p>During the following days, in spite of torrential rain, the Germans
attempted unsuccessfully to retake the lost ground, some of the attacks
being particularly fierce.</p>

<p>In the sector held by the French troops there was little more than a
heavy bombardment on either side. French raids on fortified farms held by
the Germans resulted in slight progress being made to the north of Bixschoote
and Kortekeer Inn.</p>

<p>The British, on the other hand, had to face strong counter-attacks.
On August 1, the Germans succeeded in regaining a footing in their old
advanced positions along the Ypres-Roulers Road. On the 2nd, the British
lines between St. Julien and the Ypres-Bruges railway were attacked in
force. The village of St. Julien was lost, but was finally retaken on the 3rd.
On the 4th, the British line was advanced beyond St. Julien.</p>

<p>On August 5,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> during a fresh attack on both banks of the Ypres-Comines
Canal, the Germans retook Hollebeke, but were driven out almost immediately.</p>

<p>On the night of the 5th they again attacked Hollebeke, but without
success.</p>

<p>On the 10th, an interesting operation was carried out by the British. The
front attacked was shorter than in the offensive of July 31, and extended
about a mile and a half to the south of the Ypres-Roulers Road.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the British were in complete possession of Westhoek
Village, after which a violent struggle took place for the high ground round
the village. By evening all the objectives had been attained, including the
capture of Westhoek Crest and Glencorse Wood.</p>

<p>August 12 was marked by six enemy counter-attacks, which caused a
slight withdrawal of the line to the south of Glencorse Wood. Everywhere
else the Allies' positions were fully maintained.</p>


<h3>Second Phase</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>August 15&mdash;September 19, 1917.</i>)</div>

<p>The Allies resumed their offensive on August 15 along a front of some nine
miles, from the Yser Canal to the Ypres-Menin Road.</p>

<p>The attack began at 4.45 a.m. The French attacked on both sides of
the Steenstraat-Dixmude Road, crossing the Steenbeek stream in the
morning. Driegrachten Bridgehead was taken after hand-to-hand fighting,
while in the evening the whole of the strip of ground between the Yser and
the Martjet-Vaart Canal was in the hands of the French.</p>

<p>The British operating on the right of the French rapidly attained their
first objectives, then vigorously following up this first success, they took by
assault the village of Langemarck and its strong defences, advanced 800 yards
beyond the village and captured the whole system of trenches.</p>

<p>To the south, along the Ypres-Menin Road, the struggle was more stubborn,
the Germans resisting desperately. A series of furious counter-attacks
enabled them finally to preserve their line practically intact in this district.</p>

<p>The day's captures included more than 2,000 prisoners, of whom thirty
were officers, and twenty-four guns, including several of large calibre.</p>

<p>Desperate fighting continued until September 19 without, however,
altering the positions established on August 15.</p>

<p>On August 19, the British, by small local attacks, advanced about 500
yards on the Ypres-Poelcappelle Road and captured several fortified farms.</p>

<p>The Germans made desperate efforts to hold the high wooded ground
comprising Polygone and Inverness Woods, near the Ypres-Roulers Road.</p>

<p>On the 22nd the fighting increased in fierceness. The British advanced
only with great difficulty, and the eastern edges of Inverness Wood were
hotly contested.</p>

<p>In these combats, from which neither side gained any decisive advantage,
the Germans made use for the first time of liquid fire, thanks to which
innovation they succeeded temporarily in retaking the north-western corner
of Inverness Wood, but were soon driven out.</p>

</div>

<p>Further north, the British, on August 24 and 25, advanced their lines to
the north of St. Julien and Langemarck.</p>

<p>During the following days, persistent rains prevented any further operations.
Infantry actions were now succeeded by continuous bombardments
on both sides, and by isolated raids.</p>


<h3>Third Phase</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<div class="center">(<i>September 20&mdash;October 3, 1917.</i>)</div>


<p>On September 20 a fresh offensive was begun along the whole front from
Langemarck to the Ypres-Menin Road, a distance of eight miles.</p>

<p>The part assigned for the French troops under General Anthoine was
merely to protect the left wing of the British Army which, pivoting on
Hollebeke, was to wheel and advance its marching wing in a direction at
right-angles to the Zonnebeke-Gheluvelt line.</p>

<p>All the objectives were attained at an early hour.</p>

<p>Inverness Wood, which had been hotly disputed for the six previous weeks,
was taken by the London troops.</p>

<p>The Australians retook by assault Glencorse Wood&mdash;lost a few days
before&mdash;and Nonnes Wood. The Scottish and South African Brigades
captured the fortified farms of Vampire and Borry, and the Potsdam and
Anzac Redoubts. Lancashire Territorials carried Iberian Farm and next
day (the 21st) Gallipoli Farm.</p>

<p>The British then attacked the second German lines. On the right the
Territorials<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> fought violent engagements to the north of the bend in the Ypres-Comines
Canal, near Klein Zillebeke, and in the vicinity of the position known
as Tower Hamlet.</p>

<p>In the centre, progress was more important. The ground hereabouts
rises in a small plateau about 220 feet in height, which dominates the whole
battlefield and extends in two long spurs: one running north-east towards
Zonnebeke, the other southwards towards Menin. The Germans had
fortified these positions very strongly and withdrawn their main line of
defence to the eastern edge of the plateau, <i>i.e.</i> opposite the side by which
the enemy must attack. This line protected the village of Zevenkote and
the western edge of Polygone Wood, leaving in front the woods of Nonnes,
Glencorse and Inverness, and Herenthage Park, the eastern edge of which
latter it followed. The woods were strongly fortified, and the British had
twice previously (July 31 and August 16) vainly endeavoured to capture
them.</p>

<p>It was the Northern troops and the Australians who carried these positions,
advancing to a depth of 1,700 yards and taking Veldhoek and the western
part of Polygone Wood&mdash;the principal centre of the German resistance.
Further north, Zevenkote was captured and the London Territorials, supported
by the Highlanders, seized a second line of farms.</p>

<p>In the evening of September 20, the front ran approximately as follows:
from Rose Farm (700 yards west of Poelcappelle) to Fokker Farm (on the
eastern edges of Zevenkote); across the western part of Polygone Wood&mdash;including
Veldhoek&mdash;then to the east of Herenthage Château, and ending
at Hollebeke.</p>

<p>The Germans, in their costly and unsuccessful efforts to retake the lost
positions, suffered exceedingly heavy losses, without gaining any advantage.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th the British continued their attack along a
five-mile front, from the east of St. Julien to Tower Hamlet near the Ypres-Menin
Road.</p>

<p>The rest of Tower Hamlet Spur was captured, in addition to the whole of
Polygone Wood.</p>

<p>Further north, a fresh advance of 1,700 yards was made, and the strongly
fortified village of Zonnebeke remained in the hands of the British.</p>

<p>Besides the gain in ground, more than 4,000 prisoners were taken.</p>

<p>The Germans, by a series of powerful counter-attacks, sought to win back
the lost positions. On the evening of the 26th, four attacks were made in
the neighbourhood of Tower Hamlet.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 27th they attacked the village of Zonnebeke, while on the morning
of the 30th three attacks were made, without result, on both sides of the
Ypres-Menin Road.</p>

<p>On October 1 the Germans attacked three times on a front of 1,700 yards
to the south of the Ypres-Menin Road, while the same night two fresh
assaults gave no appreciable result.</p>

<h3>Fourth Phase</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>October 4&mdash;8, 1917.</i>)</div>

<p>The increasing activity of the Germans did not in any way prevent the
British from preparing a fresh offensive. On the morning of October 4,
English divisions, supported by Welsh, Scottish and Irish battalions, attacked
along a front of ten miles, between Tower Hamlet and the north of Langemarck.
The Germans, disconcerted and surprised by this unexpected attack&mdash;they
were themselves preparing to attack with five divisions&mdash;fell back from the
beginning of the action.</p>

<span class="caption">PART OF THE GROUND COVERED BY THE OFFENSIVE,
SEEN FROM AN AEROPLANE</span>
</div>

<p>A rapid advance of
one-half to nearly two
miles was made.</p>

<p>South of the Menin
Road the objectives were
attained almost at the
outset.</p>

<p>To the north of the
same road the enemy resistance
was more stubborn.
Nevertheless, the
villages of Reutel and
Polderhoek, together with
the château of that name,
were captured, freeing at
the same time the top of
the crest, whose eastern
slopes run down to the
village of Bacelaere.
Further north, the
Australians captured
Noordhemhoek and Molenaarelsthoek,
reached
Broodseinde Crest, and
thus advanced beyond
the Bacelaere-Broodseinde
Road.</p>

<p>On the other side of
the Ypres-Roulers railway,
the British drew
appreciably nearer Passchendaele,
captured
Gravenstafel and a certain number of fortified farms, and approached the
western outskirts of Poelcappelle.</p>

<span class="caption">FOURTH STAGE: THE 4TH OCTOBER, 1917 (4/10)</span>
</div>

<p>In spite of the violent storm which was then raging, all the objectives
were attained and the line of crests conquered.</p>

<p>Owing to the very large numbers of troops massed on the front at the time
of the attack, the German losses, which included 4,500 prisoners, were
particularly heavy.</p>

</div>


<h3>Fifth Phase</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>October 9&mdash;12, 1917.</i>)</div>

<p>To completely clear Ypres, a few strongly fortified villages beyond the
line of crests captured on October 4 had still to be taken. These formed
the objective of the attacks of October 9 and 12.</p>

<p>On October 9, in spite of the appalling weather, the British attacked again
on a front stretching from St. Janshoek (a mile north of Bixschoote) to the
south-east of Broodseinde. The French were holding a front rather less than
two miles in length to the north of Bixschoote, and had for objective the
southern edge of Houthulst Forest.</p>

<p>The signal to attack was given at 5.30 a.m. Despite the rain, which had
been falling incessantly for several days, the infantry crossed first the canal
in flood, then a veritable sea of mud, and captured Mangelaere and Veldhoek.
They advanced rather more than a mile and reached the south-western edge
of Houthulst Forest, after having captured numerous strongly fortified farms
and blockhouses.</p>

<p>The British sector extended from the north-west of Poelcappelle to Broodseinde,
and formed a front of some seven miles.</p>

<p>On the right, the Manchester Regiment and the Lancashire Fusiliers
advanced from 1,600 to 2,000 yards in the direction of Passchendaele, and
carried the line beyond the crests occupied on October 4.</p>

<p>In the centre, many farms, redoubts and blockhouses were captured.</p>

<span class="caption">FIFTH STAGE: THE BRITISH ATTACK HOUTHULST FOREST AND APPROACH

</div>

<p>To the north, the capture of Poelcappelle was completed, the British
joining hands with the French on the outskirts of Houthulst Forest.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 prisoners were taken.</p>

</div>


<h3>Sixth Phase</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>October 22&mdash;November 6, 1917.</i>)</div>

<p>After a short rest, during which the new positions were consolidated&mdash;in
view of enemy counter-attacks&mdash;the battle broke out afresh on October 22.</p>

<p>The attack of the 22nd was, in reality, only of secondary importance, but
thanks to the progress made, it was possible to carry out the operations of
the 26th on a larger scale than originally intended.</p>

<p>In order definitely to consolidate the captured positions, it was still
necessary to take the village of Passchendaele, which stands on the high
ground dominating the plain of Flanders to the east of Ypres and from which
Roulers is visible.</p>

<p>A fresh offensive was accordingly begun at dawn on October 26.</p>

<p>In the French sector, the troops, after wading through the St. Janshoek
and the Corverbeek streams with the water up to their shoulders, stormed the
village of Draeibank, Papegoed Wood, and many fortified farms.</p>

<p>The next day fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> progress, to a depth of more than a mile, was made on
both sides of the Ypres-Dixmude Road, along a front of two and a half
miles. The villages of Hoekske, Aschhoop, Merckem, and Kippe were
captured, and the western edges of Houthulst Forest reached.</p>

<p>On the 28th, the advance continued on the left, in co-operation with the
Belgians. The French took the village of Luyghem, and the Belgians
Vyfhuyzen.</p>

<p>The British, on their part, advanced in the direction of Passchendaele, as
far as the southern slopes of the village, capturing a whole series of positions
east of Poelcappelle.</p>

<p>On October 30, British and Canadians continued their attacks, and in
spite of the enemy's desperate resistance, reached the first houses of
Passchendaele.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<span class="caption">FRENCH TROOPS PASSING IN FRONT OF THE RUINS OF YPRES CLOTH HALL</span>
</div>

<p>On the following days they improved their positions. The struggle at
this juncture was very bitter, Hindenburg having shortly before issued an
order stating: "<i>Passchendaele must be held at all costs, and retaken if lost.</i>"</p>

<p>On the morning of November 6, the British resumed the offensive. The
Canadians, after bloody engagements to the north and north-west of Passchendaele,
captured the hamlets of Mosselmarkt and Goudberg, and finally carried
Passchendaele.</p>

<p>On the evening of November 6, Ypres was completely cleared; and from
the top of the Passchendaele Hills the valiant British troops could see, stretching
away to the horizon, the Plain of Flanders, which had been hidden from
the Allies since October, 1914.</p>

<h3>The German Offensive of 1918</h3>

<p>The front was quiet during the winter of 1917&mdash;1918, but 1918 opened
darkly for the Allies.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Brest-Litowsk had sealed the defection of Russia, while
Roumania, reduced to her own resources, was forced to sign the Treaty of
Bukarest. Lastly, invaded Italy was only just recovering from the disaster
at Caporetto. Already, in spite of the terms of the Brest-Litowsk Treaty,
huge masses of troops, guns and stores were being despatched to the Western
Front. The blow fell on March 21, 1918.</p>

<p>The objectives, three in number, were the smashing of the British right
wing at its junction with the French; the separation of the two Allied army
groups; the driving back to the Channel coast of the two British armies,
after they had been surrounded on the south. The long-coveted road "<i>Nach
Paris</i>" would then at last be open.</p>

<p>But in spite of their colossal efforts the Germans were held.</p>

<p>By March 31, the German Imperial forces were exhausted, and General
Foch was able to say: "<i>The wave has spent itself on the beach.</i>" The peril
seemed to be averted.</p>

<p>But the respite was only a short one. The German attack before Amiens
was scarcely stayed (April 6) when the battle suddenly broke out again.
From the Arras sector to La Bassée the whole line was ablaze as far as the
Lys. While, in the first German offensive the British right had suffered
severely, it was against the left wing of the same army that the new blow
was struck.</p>

<p>The new offensive, although quickly prepared, was even more violent
than the first.</p>

<p>On April 9, when the attack began, the German battle-front between the
Lys and La Bassée was held by twenty-one divisions in line and six in reserve,
under the command of Von Quast (VIth Army).</p>

<p>Of these twenty-seven divisions only seven were in line on March 28.</p>

<p>Ten divisions were hurriedly brought up from the Belgian front
(IVth Army&mdash;Von Arnim), which was holding the sector from the Lys to the
Channel. Five others were despatched from the Artois front, and, lastly,
five divisions were taken from General Ludendorff's general reserve.</p>

<h2>THE BATTLE OF THE FLANDERS HILLS</h2>


<h3>The Break-Through</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>April 9, 1918.</i>)</div>

<p>The Germans began the attack on the morning of April 9, after an intense
bombardment with gas shells, and under cover of a dense fog reached the
first machine-guns. The sector was held by Portuguese troops, wedged in
between the British, from Bois-Grenier to Neuve-Chapelle.</p>

<p>On the whole length of front attacked, between La Bassée and Armentières,
in the Plain of Flanders, the only natural obstacles are the rivers and
canals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> From the beginning of the battle the Portuguese were thrown into
disorder by the extreme violence of the attack.</p>

<p>The twenty-one German shock divisions attacked in five columns: to the
south, the first column in the direction of Givenchy; the second (General
Kraevel), in front of Festubert; the third (Von Bernhardi) marched against
La Couture and Richebourg-St.-Waast; the Carlowitz Corps, forming the
fourth column, advanced against Estaires in the direction of Laventie;
further north, the fifth column attacked in the direction of Fleurbaix, outflanking
Bois Grenier and Armentières on the west.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of the attack, a depression was formed in the line.
Fleurbaix, Laventie, Richebourg-St.-Waast and Neuve-Chapelle were lost,
and the Germans reached the Lys between Estaires and the St. Maur Ferry.
To the north of the pocket the Allies resisted successfully at Fleurbaix;
to the south, Givenchy, after a desperate struggle, remained in the hands
of the British.</p>

<p>On the following day the German troops, continuing the push towards
the centre, succeeded in crossing the Lys between Estaires and the St. Maur
Ferry.</p>

<p>The battle extended northwards and the IVth Army (Von Arnim)
attacked between Armentières and Ploegsteert with the Eberhardt, Marschall
and Sieger Corps.</p>

<p>The push continued on the 11th, and Armentières, outflanked on the north
and south, smashed by the shells and drenched with gas, had to be evacuated.</p>

<p>On their left, the Germans, after crossing the Lawe, north of Locon, two
miles from Béthune, captured Neuf-Berquin and Merville.</p>

<p>Givenchy, held by the British 55th Division, resisted all attacks and
remained in their hands.</p>

<p>On the right, Nieppe and Steenwerk had to be evacuated. The German
advance to the south of Armentières becoming more pronounced, the British
straightened their front, to avoid too sharp a salient, and fell back to the
Messines-Wytschaete Crest.</p>

<p>On the 12th the fighting continued furiously. Advancing along the Lille-Hazebrouck
railway, the Germans reached the outskirts of Nieppe Forest.
South-west of Merville they captured Calonne, and, further north, approached
Bailleul.</p>

<p>North of the Lys, under pressure of Von Arnim's army, the Messines-Wytschaete
Crest, with the wood and village of Ploegsteert, had to be abandoned.
The British line was withdrawn to Neuve-Eglise and Wulverghem.
In these few days the gains of the Allied offensive of the last five months of
1917 were lost.</p>

<p>The 13th marked the culminating point of the battle in the central sector.
Foch made his dispositions promptly, and French reinforcements were despatched
to the critical points.</p>

<p>Von Bernhardi crossed the Clarence at Robecq on the 13th. On the
same day Von Gallwitz made a strong push northwards between Hazebrouck
and Bailleul, with the object of outflanking the line of the Flanders Hills,
already attacked on the east and north-east by the IVth Army (Von
Arnim).</p>

<p>Battles were fought south of Meteren, at Merris, Vieux-Berquin and on the
eastern outskirts of Nieppe Forest. To the east of Bailleul, Neuve-Eglise (an
important cross-road) was fiercely disputed. After changing hands many
times on the 14th, it was finally abandoned the same night.</p>

<p>The loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> of Neuve-Eglise led to that of Wulverghem, and the British
were forced to fall back to the eastern slopes of Kemmel Hill, the first high
point in the chain of hills called the Heights or Hills of Flanders. From
east to west this chain consists of Rouge Hill (flanked on the north-east by
Scherpenberg), Vidaigne Hill, Noir Hill, Cats Hill, and lastly by the western
bastion of Cassel.</p>

<p>After taking Neuve-Eglise on the night of the 14th, the Germans decided
on a fresh and still more powerful effort.</p>

<p>Three picked divisions were hurled against the hills of Lille and Ravetsberg,
to the east of Bailleul, which fell. The Germans entered Bailleul,
pushing on thence to Meteren, which they also captured. The next day
they tried to develop this success, but instead of the exhausted British, the
Germans now found themselves faced by fresh French troops. In three days
(April 12&mdash;14) Pétain had brought up without a hitch five French divisions
and one cavalry corps, which stayed the German rush at the foot of the hills.</p>

<span class="caption">ROUGE HILL, SEEN FROM SCHERPENBERG HILL</span>
</div>

<p>On April 16 the Germans made their first attempt to turn the Flanders
Hills from the south-west in the direction of Hazebrouck.</p>

<p>The French 133rd Infantry Division (Valentin), supported by the British
34th Division, vigorously repulsed the attack.</p>

<p>On the 17th a fresh and more powerful attack was made simultaneously
from the north-east, towards Poperinghe, and from the south, on the Bailleul-Neuve-Eglise
front.</p>

<p>At the same time an independent operation&mdash;which failed completely&mdash;was
undertaken to the north of Ypres on the Belgian front. The Belgians
repulsed the Germans and took 800 prisoners.</p>

<p>To the south three British divisions (34th, 49th, 19th) stayed the German
advance.</p>

<p>A last effort, starting from Wytschaete, also broke down before the
French 28th Infantry Division (Madelin).</p>

<h3>The Capture of Kemmel Hill</h3>

<div class="center">(<i>April 22&mdash;28, 1918.</i>)</div>

<p>A period of comparative calm followed, during which the Germans
prepared a fresh mass attack, in view of the capture of the Hills.</p>

<p>For this new offensive five fresh divisions from Alsace-Lorraine were
brought up, of which two&mdash;the IVth Bavarians and the Alpine Corps&mdash;were
picked troops. These troops joined the four divisions already in the sector.
The artillery was also considerably reinforced.</p>

<p>During this concentration small local attacks occurred on both sides.</p>

<p>On April 22 and 23 the Germans endeavoured to improve their positions
north of Bailleul, but without appreciable result.</p>

<p>The French, on their part, sought by attacks and raids to impede the
preparations for the coming assault.</p>

<p>At that time the firing line, from west to east, ran as follows: from
Meteren (held by the Germans) it passed north of Bailleul, then crossed the
crest of Lindenhoek at Dranoutre, east of Kemmel, and skirted Groote
Vierstraat and St. Eloi on the east.</p>

<p>The five French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> divisions which defended the Hills occupied the following
positions:</p>

<p>The 133rd before Cats Hill; the 34th Infantry (Sabatier) before Locre;
the 154th Infantry (Breton) from Dranoutre to the Petit-Kemmel; the
28th Infantry (Madelin) before Kemmel Hill, its left linking up at Lindenhoek
with the British 9th Infantry Division. The Cavalry Corps was held
in reserve on the Hills.</p>

<p>At 2.30 a.m. on April 25 the attack began with a heavy bombardment,
in which the proportion of gas shells was far greater than previously.</p>

<p>At about 6 a.m. the infantry assault began in a dense fog north and south
of Kemmel Hill.</p>

<p>North of the Hills the "Sieger" divisions, marching west to east, had
orders to capture Kemmel Village, and then, <i>via</i> the Valley of the Kemmelbeek,
join up at Locre with the Eberhardt Divisions, which were attacking
from north to south in the direction of Dranoutre.</p>

<p>On the left of the attacking front, the village of Kemmel was taken by
the Germans, in spite of a heroic defence. Step by step the British
9th Division was driven back into Kemmelbeek valley and on Dickebusch
Pond.</p>

<p>In the centre the enemy storm-troop waves, after several repulses, finally
reached the summit of Kemmel Hill, where a fierce hand-to-hand encounter
took place. In spite of their great heroism, the 30th Infantry Regiment,
outnumbered and almost surrounded, was forced to abandon the position,
but only after a dashing counter-attack by a battalion of the 99th Infantry
had failed to extricate them. On the right, the German Alpine Corps, by a
daring man&oelig;uvre, made possible by the fog and the broken nature of the
ground, succeeded in reaching the artillery positions, which were at once
attacked by machine-gun fire. The French and British batteries, under a
storm of bullets, were obliged to retreat, saving what material they could
and blowing up the rest.</p>

<p>The Germans thus reached the village of Locre, which changed hands
several times during the day.</p>

<p>Finally, after a counter-attack, the 154th Infantry Division remained
masters of the village, although the Germans succeeded in holding the
"hospice" at the southern end.</p>

<p>The situation was now critical and the enemy advance had to be checked
at all costs. On the night of the 25th the Allies were reinforced by the
39th Infantry Division (Massenet) at the very moment a fresh German
offensive was being launched. The timely arrival of these troops effectually
stayed the German thrust.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 26th, after much sanguinary fighting, the enemy
paused, exhausted. The French took advantage of the respite to consolidate
new positions.</p>

<p>The 27th was marked only by a violent attack on the extreme left at
Voormezele, where the Germans succeeded in obtaining a footing, only to be
driven out by a vigorous British counter-attack.</p>

<p>As a result of these various battles the new line was as follows: from
Locre Château it ran south of Locre Village, followed Kemmelbeek Valley,
passed in front of La Clytte Village, then south of Dickebusch Pond and
Voormezele Village, joining up with Zillebeke on the south-east.</p>

<p>It was against this new front that the Germans were now preparing a
new offensive.</p>

<h2>THE LAST GERMAN ATTACK</h2>

<span class="caption">ON APRIL 29, THE GERMANS LAUNCHED A LAST FURIOUS ATTACK AGAINST THE
HILLS, AND FAILED. EXHAUSTED, THEY THEN ABANDONED THEIR PLANS FOR
TAKING YPRES</span>
</div>

<p>After an artillery preparation lasting all night, the attack began at
7 a.m. on April 29, along a front about eight and a half miles in length,
extending from the Château and Park of Locre to Dickebusch Pond. This
attack, by no less than 120,000 enemy troops, resulted in a crushing defeat
for the Germans.</p>

<p>Both ends of the front stood firm: the British on the left, between La
Clytte and Zillebeke, and the French on the right, in the Château and Park
of Locre. All attacks were vigorously repulsed, and the Germans did not
even reach the Allied lines.</p>

<p>More fortunate in the centre, they succeeded in taking the village of
Locre, and advanced beyond it as far as the cross-ways on the Westoutre
Road, half-a-mile north of Locre. Their success was but short-lived, however,
as a vigorous counter-attack by French Dragoons drove them back, and at the
end of the day all that remained of their gains was a slight salient near
Brulooze Inn. Exhausted, they did not renew their attack.</p>

<p>The Hill offensive was over. The Germans had destroyed Ypres, but
could not enter the ruined city.</p>

<h2>THE ALLIES' VICTORY OFFENSIVE OF AUGUST&mdash;OCTOBER, 1918</h2>

<p>After the German setback of April 29, the initiative passed into the hands
of the Allies.</p>

<p>On April 30, the French 39th Infantry Division reduced the Brulooze Inn
salient. During the following week numerous local engagements enabled the
Allies to recapture several fortified farms and <i>points d'appui</i>, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to consolidate their positions. An attack by the British, on July 19, to the
north of the Lys, advanced their lines two and a half miles, and gave them
the village of Meteren. Then followed a lull, which lasted until the speeding-up
of Foch's offensive rendered the German positions untenable and forced
the conquered enemy back towards the Rhine.</p>

<p>After the Allies' victorious counter-thrust had flattened out the "pocket"
made by the German Spring offensive near Amiens, the battle quickly spread
over the whole front, including Flanders.</p>

<p>East of Nieppe Forest and Hazebrouck, the British, pressing forward
towards Armentières, advanced beyond Vieux-Berquin in the direction of
Merville. On August 18, they joined battle between Vieux-Berquin and
Bailleul, on a front of four miles, and captured the village of Outtersteene.
The next day they entered Merville.</p>

<span class="caption">GERMAN POSITION NORTH OF YPRES, CAPTURED BY BELGIAN TROOPS

</div>

<p>On September 1, the British had reached the line: La Bassée, Laventie,
Steenwerke, Neuve-Eglise and Wulverghem, on both sides of the Lys. On
the following day, Estaires was outflanked south of Lens, and the famous
Hindenburg line passed. Noreuil, Villers-au-Flos (south of Quéant), Le
Transloy, Sailly-Saillisel and Allaines (south of the Bapaume-Cambrai Road)
were next captured. Further south the storming of Quéant by the Canadians,
who then advanced beyond, and approached Marquion, opened the road to
Cambrai.</p>

<p>On September 4, the British reached the Canal du Nord, and crossed
it at several points. On the following day, they regained possession of their
old lines on both sides of the Lys, from Neuve-Chapelle to Givenchy, and
captured Ploegsteert Village. On September 10, south-west of Cambrai,
Gouzeaucourt Wood and the old line of trenches dominating Gouzeaucourt
Village, as well as the outskirts of Havrincourt Wood were occupied.</p>

<p>The general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> offensive was to be launched a few days later, in co-operation
with the Belgian Army and some French units.</p>

<p>On September 28, the Belgian Army and the British Second Army (General
Plumer), commanded by King Albert, marched against the army of Von
Arnim. The British, covered on the north by the Belgians, began a turning
movement in the region of Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing. Houthulst Forest,
the crests of Passchendaele and Gheluvelt, and Dixmude were carried with
fine dash. Crossing the Lys on the following days between Wervicq and
Comines, the British now drew near to Menin. On October 1, the Germans
were in full retreat on a wide front north and south of the Bassée Canal,
all their positions between Armentières and the south of Lens being now
abandoned.</p>

<span class="caption">DESTROYED BRITISH TANK SUNK IN THE MUD AT THE ENTRANCE TO

</div>

<p>On October 9, the Canadians of the First Army occupied Cambrai. On
the 13th, the British reached the gates of Douai and occupied the banks of
the Haute-Deule Canal from Douai to Vendin-le-Vieil.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the British Second Army, after capturing Menin and Wervicq,
obtained a footing on the right bank of the Lys, then crossed the river between
Menin and Armentières, thus forcing the Germans to abandon the line of the
Haute-Deule, and taking the Lille-Tourcoing in the rear.</p>

<p>The British army and some French units occupied Lille&mdash;capital of the
north&mdash;on October 17, and the same days the Germans evacuated Douai.
Roubaix and Tourcoing were liberated the next day, and Denain, Marchiennes
and Orchies on the 21st and 22nd.</p>

<p>The Western suburbs of Valenciennes were fiercely disputed, being finally
retaken on November 2 by the Canadian troops under General Currie.</p>

<p>A few days later the Armistice was signed, and the victory of the Allied
armies sealed.</p>

<h2>VISIT TO THE BATTLEFIELD</h2>


<p>A visit to Ypres Town and Salient requires two days, and may be made
most conveniently by taking Lille as the starting-point.</p>

<p><i>First Day</i>: Visit Messines, Wytschaete, Houthem, Zondvoorde, Gheluvelt,
Becelaere, Zonnebeke, Passchendaele, Langemarck, Ypres, Zollebeke and
Hooge, spending the night at Poperinghe.</p>

<p><i>Second Day</i>: Visit the Hills: Scherpenberg, Vidaigne, Rouge and Kemmel;
then, after re-crossing the French frontier, those of Cats and Noir, returning
to Lille for the night, via Armentières, Estaires, Béthune and La Bassée.</p>

<p><i>At Canteleu follow the tram-lines leading to Lomme. At the end of the
village, cross the railway (l. c.). Go through Lomme by Rue Thiers, leaving
the church on the right</i> (transept greatly damaged).</p>

<p>On the left are the burnt ruins of a large spinning mill. In the fields:
numerous small forts of reinforced concrete, which commanded all the roads
into Lille. The road passes through a small wood, in the right-hand part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which are the ruins of Premesques Château, of which only the façade remains.
Further on, to the left, is Wez Macquart, whose church was badly damaged.
Trenches lead to the road, while in the fields, traces of the violent shelling
are still visible.</p>

<p><i>Pass through Chapelle d'Armentières (completely destroyed). After
crossing the railway (l. c.), a British cemetery is seen on the right.</i>
<b>Armentières</b> <i>lies on the other side of the next level crossing.</i></p>

<p><i>After entering</i> <b>Armentières</b>, <i>and immediately beyond the railway, take
Rue du Faubourg de Lille, leaving the Church of St. Roch on the right.

completely ruined. <i>Take a few steps along Rue de Dunkerque, then turn
into the first street on the right, which leads to the Place de l'Eglise
St. Waast.</i></p>


<h3>Armentières</h3>

<p>Armentières suffered in many wars, being taken by the English in 1339,
by the French in 1382, by the Calvinists in 1566, by Marshals de Gassion
and De Rantzau in 1645, and by the Archduke Leopold in 1647.</p>

<p>Occupied by the Germans in August, 1914, it was retaken in September.
Nearly four years later (April, 1918) it again fell into the hands of the enemy.
On October 2, it was finally liberated by General Plumer's army.</p>

<p>Until the later war, Armentières had preserved its 17th century belfry
of chimes, its church of Nôtre-Dame, and another church dedicated to
St. Waast&mdash;patron saint of the town.</p>

<p>This personage, to whom many of the churches in this district have been
dedicated, was Bishop of Arras in the 6th century. While still a priest, he
is said to have cured a blind beggar in the presence of Clovis. This miracle
was one of the causes which led to the conversion of the king, to whom
St. Waast acted instructor in the Faith.</p>

<p>The town also possessed a national technical school, dating from the
previous century.</p>

<p>In everything connected with the spinning and weaving of linen Armentières,
like Lille, Roubaix, Tourcoing, and the whole of Northern France in
general, was considerably in advance of Germany. Consequently, the
Germans destroyed all the mills, factories and metallurgical works, and what
machinery could not be taken to pieces and sent to Germany they ruthlessly
smashed.</p>

<p>On November 3, 1914, during the First Battle of Ypres, it fell into the
hands of the enemy. At four o'clock on the following day, the ground

scene of several furious attacks (see p. 8).</p>

<p>Messines was destroyed by the British bombardment during the offensive
of June, 1917. The New Zealanders captured it on June 7, in spite of a
stubborn defence. They also took the neighbouring village of Wytschaete
(see p. 20). Messines again fell into German hands in April, 1918 (see p. 39),
and was finally retaken on September 30 during the last battle (see p. 46).</p>

<p><i>Return to the car and take the Ypres road on the left</i> (photo, p. 58).
Along this road are numerous little bridges thrown across the shell-holes.</p>

<p><b>Wytschaete</b>, which is soon reached, was captured, like Messines, in the
first battle of 1914, and retaken by the New Zealanders on June 7, 1917.
After being entirely destroyed by bombardment (see p. 20), it was lost again
on April 15, 1918, then retaken on September 30, 1918.</p>

<p><i>At the fork, just before entering the village</i>&mdash;protected by a series of
powerful blockhouses&mdash;<i>take the road on the right leading to Oosttaverne</i>
(now totally destroyed). <i>Follow the main road</i> (Ypres-Warneton) <i>on the
right as far as the place called Gapaard</i> (photo below), <i>then turn to the left
along the road to Houthem.</i> A series of little bridges over shell-craters full
of water&mdash;once the River Wanbecke&mdash;are crossed.</p>

<p><i>Go through Houthem</i>, which was razed to the ground. Beyond an
armoured shelter built against the brick wall of a house, <i>the road turns to
the left. Cross the canal by the temporary bridge.</i></p>

<p>The old bed of the canal is marked by some crumbling blocks of concrete.
<i>A few yards further on, take the level-crossing over the Ypres-Lille Railway.</i>
It was on this line that on October 22 and 23, 1914, the Germans brought
up an armoured train which bombarded Ypres with incendiary shells, causing
the first serious damage to the town.</p>

<p><i>A few hundred yards beyond the railway turn to the right at the village
of Kortewilde</i>, where a few wooden houses are being erected among the ruins.
<i>After crossing a number of little bridges over the Gaverbeck canal, the road,
rising slightly, turns to the right.</i> At this turning the Château (photo above)
and village of <b>Hollebeke</b> ought to be visible on the left, but this part of the
battlefield is in so chaotic a condition that neither road, canal, nor village
can be distinguished.</p>

<p>During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> the first battle (November, 1914) the Germans launched attacks
in great force between Hollebeke and Messines, and captured both these
places. Hollebeke was retaken on July 13, 1917, during the first phase of
the great British offensive for the clearing of the town. After being lost again
in April, 1918, Hollebeke was finally recaptured by the Allies in October.</p>

<p><i>The road first rises, then descends.</i> On the hillside are the ruins of Zandvoorde.
<i>At the entrance to the village take the Zillebeke-Wervicq road
on the left, then first to the right, then to the left, between two wooden
houses. The road descends, then, undulating slightly, joins the main road
from Ypres to Menin, opposite Gheluvelt,</i> the site of which is marked by a
sign-post.</p>

<p>This was one of the important strategic points in the first German offensive
of 1914 (see p. 7), when the village was captured by the enemy. During
the battle for the clearing of Ypres, fierce fighting took place to the west of
<b>Gheluvelt</b>, especially at Tower Hamlet. From November, 1917, to April,
1918, the firing-line ran through the village. Gheluvelt was retaken by the
British in October, 1918.</p>

<p><i>Take the main road from Ypres to Menin on the right. Only at Gheluvelt
will a passable road to Becelaere be found</i>.</p>

<p>In Gheluvelt, where there are still a few broken walls standing, turn to
the left at the fork in the road, leaving the ruined church on the right. At
the next fork take the right-hand road to the ruined hamlet of Terhand.</p>

<p>Fifty yards before the crossing with the Dadizelle Road, there is a German
cemetery on the right, containing a remarkable concrete monument, thirty feet
in height, which dominates the whole plain. This monument (photo, p. 62)
was in reality a German observation post. Inside there were two floors.
An outside staircase led to a platform. Traces of the balustrade are visible
in the photo.</p>

there are many shelters.</p>

<p>To the west of the road from Becelaere to Zonnebeke lay Polygone
Wood, which was entirely destroyed. The British made two unsuccessful
attempts (July 31 and August 16, 1917) to take this strongly fortified wood,
succeeding eventually on September 20 (see p. 28). Evacuated by the
British in April, 1918, the wood was finally recaptured by the Allies in
October, 1918.</p>

<p>Beyond the place called Noordenhoek there is a bend in the road. On
the left, Zonnebeke Pond, the ruined château, and the remains of a gasometer
come into sight (photo below).</p>

<p><i>At the place called Broodseinde take the Ypres-Roulers road on the left,
to visit the ruins of Zonnebeke.</i></p>

<p><b>Zonnebeke</b> was taken in 1914 by the Germans, who made an outpost of
it in front of their lines. The village was recaptured on September 26, then
lost in April, 1918, and finally retaken in the following October.</p>

<p><i>Return to the fork</i> (which was commanded by numerous small forts),
<i>and turn to the left:</i> military cemetery at the side of the road. In the
fields on the right, 200 yards beyond the level crossing, there is a monument
to the memory of 148 officers and men of the Canadian 85th Battalion (photo,
p. 64).</p>

<p>Passing through shell-torn country, <b>Passchendaele</b>&mdash;now razed to the
ground&mdash;is reached. All that remains of the church is the mound seen in
the background of the photograph (p. 64).</p>

<p>Passchendaele was captured by the Germans in November, 1914, and
later by the British (October 26, 1917). The village had already been wiped
out by the bombardment, but the position, which dominated Ypres and
Roulers, was an important one. The fighting there was of the fiercest,
Hindenburg having ordered it to be held at all costs. However, the British
broke down the enemy's stubborn resistance.</p>

<p>Langemarck, defended by the French in 1914, was evacuated on December
17 of that year. Recaptured, the town was lost again on April 21, 1915,
during the German gas attack.</p>

<h2>YPRES</h2>

<p>Few names awaken more memories than that of Ypres&mdash;a city of
incomparable splendour in the Middle Ages, and of which nothing now remains
but a heap of ruins. Of the last precious traces of this ancient prosperity,
the rich and splendid buildings which filled the mind with wonder&mdash;the
immense Cloth Hall, the beautiful cathedral, the churches, the sumptuous
mansions, the sculptured houses&mdash;the German guns have spared nothing.
History furnishes few examples of such grandeur followed by destruction so
swift and so complete. Ypres is now but a memory.</p>


<h3>Chief Historical Events</h3>

<p>The Town of Ypres (Latin Ypra, Flemish Ieperen) grew up in the 10th
century around a fortified castle, rebuilt about 958 by Baudoin, Count of
Flanders. This castle had been in existence since the 8th century, but only
the ruins had survived Norman invasions.</p>

<p>The town, favourably situated in the centre of the maritime plain with
its rich grassy meadows intersected by canals, prospered exceedingly.
A numerous population sprang up of merchants and artisans, whose chief
sources of wealth were the manufacture and sale of cloth.</p>

<p>As early as the 12th, but especially in the 13th and 14th centuries, Ypres,
thanks to important privileges granted by the Counts of Flanders, became
a considerable town, and possessed 4,000 looms.</p>

<p>Flanders, the meeting-point of the three great European states&mdash;England,
France and Germany&mdash;was then the industrial centre <i>par excellence</i> of the
west and the rendezvous of all the merchants of the old world. This explains
the splendour of the towns of Flanders in the Middle Ages, not only Ypres,
but Bruges, Ghent, etc.</p>

<p>This prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> was often a temptation to the Kings of France, who led
many an expedition into Flanders. Ypres was taken by Louis VI. in 1128,
by Philippe-Auguste in 1213, by Philippe-le-Bel in 1297, but the town was
little damaged in these wars.</p>

<p>It suffered more in the 14th century. Riots, and the siege and destruction
of the town by the people of Ghent in 1383, caused many of the weavers to
emigrate, and left as its only industry the manufacture of Valenciennes lace.
At that time the Counts of Flanders were French princes. Robert de Béthune
was succeeded in 1322 by the Count of Nevers, whose family reigned until
1384. This dynasty ended with Louis-le-Mâle, and Philippe-le-Hardi, Duke
of Burgundy, became Count of Flanders. Under the rule of these Dukes,
who were fairly wise and moderate statesmen&mdash;Flanders being a source of
considerable revenue, and the Flemish people quick to revolt against any
violation of their privileges&mdash;Ypres prospered greatly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i-072.jpg" width="900" height="779" alt="YPRES IN THE 16TH CENTURY" title="" />
<span class="caption">YPRES IN THE 16TH CENTURY</span>
</div>

<p>In 1481 Flanders passed under the rule of Austria (Marie, heiress of
Burgundy, had married the Archduke Maximilian), then in 1558 under that
of Spain. In 1559 it replaced Thérouanne as the centre of the diocese.</p>

<p>At that time it had lost much of its splendour. Towards the end of the
15th century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> it was depopulated by a dreadful pestilence, and about the
middle of the following century, a second outbreak completed the ruin of
the town. It was just beginning to recover when it was captured by the
<i>Gueux</i> and the troops of the Duc d'Albe and Alexandre Farnèse, who
massacred most of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the 17th century Ypres was taken by the French on four occasions&mdash;1648,
1649, 1658 and 1678&mdash;finally reverting to France under the Treaty of
Nimègue at about the latter date. Vauban fortified it. Retaken by the
Imperial Troops in 1715, Ypres was restored to France in 1792, and under the
Empire became the capital of the Département of Lys. The treaties of 1815
gave it back to the Netherlands, and since 1830 it has formed part of the
Kingdom of Belgium.</p>

<span class="caption">GERMAN BOMBARDMENT OF THE ASYLUM</span>
</div>

<p>In 1914 the population numbered 18,000. Its principal industries were
the manufacture of woollen goods, printed cottons, linens, ribbons, and
Valenciennes lace. Its tanneries and dye works were also of considerable
importance. It was a clean, well-built town, watered by the river Yperlée.
The many arms of the latter ran through the streets of the town, enabling the
boats loaded with merchandise to come right up to the warehouses.</p>

<p>These waterways are now covered in. Formerly there was a path on each
side of them, which explains the exceptional width of the streets and squares
of Ypres.</p>

<h2>YPRES</h2>

<h3>A Visit to the Ruins</h3>

<p><i>The tourist enters Ypres by the Dixmude Gate.</i></p>

<p>At No. 54 Rue de Dixmude is the façade of the Maison Biebuygk, on the
right. Built in 1544, this house was one of the most remarkable in Ypres.
Immediately below the gable were two carved medallions representing the
sun and the moon. The great pointed arch which framed the gable windows
gave exceptional grace to the façade (photos, p. 73).</p>

<p>At No. 66 of the same street, on the left, the 18th century façade shown in
the photographs (p. 74), was still standing in July, 1919. It was decorated
with statues of the Virgin Mary and St. François, under fluted niches with
carved borders.</p>

<h2>THE CLOTH HALL AND THE NIEUWERK</h2>

<p>The Cloth Hall, containing extensive warehouses, in which the sale of
cloth was carried on, was built in the 13th and 14th centuries. It consisted
of a series of buildings grouped around a rectangular court. The Hall proper
was distinguished from a building called the Nieuwerk, added in the 17th
century. The southern building of the hall had a magnificent façade, flanked
on the east by the gable of the Nieuwerk and surmounted by a large belfry in
the centre. Bold turrets stood at both ends of this façade. Rather spare in
ornament, the long succession of glazed and blind windows constituted the
grandeur of the façade. On the ground-floor, which was lighted by a row of
quatrefoil windows in pointed arches, there were forty-eight rectangular
doors.</p>

<p>Above these doors were the high windows of the upper storey, the Hall
having two floors. These windows were alternately glazed and blind&mdash;a
method frequently adopted in the Middle Ages, to avoid weakness in the walls,
without detracting from the symmetry of the exterior. This storey was
reached by staircases, access to which was gained through doors at each end
of the façade.</p>

<p>The glazed windows were decorated with three trefoils supported on two
arches. The blind windows were similar to the windows of the ground-floor,
except that the latter were less lofty. The two arches formed niches, each of
which contained a statue: that of a Count of Flanders (the Counts and
Countesses from Baudoin Bras-de-Fer to Charles Quint were represented) or
of a notable citizen of Ypres, such as Melchior Broederlam, the painter. These
statues, some of which were restored in the 19th century, rested on a corbel
apparently supported by a small figure bearing the coat-of-arms of the
sovereign represented.</p>

</div>

<p>The upper portion of the walls was decorated with an ornamental frieze
and a battlement bordered with fine moulding. The frieze was composed of
a tricusped arcade with small columns carried on corbels with carved heads.</p>

<p>Behind the battlements ran a sentry-way, while at the ends of the façade
turrets decorated with arcades and surmounted by octagonal spires, served
as watch-towers.</p>

<p>The Belfry rose from the centre of the buildings, of which it was the
oldest part, the foundation-stone having been laid by Baudoin <b>IX</b>., Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of Flanders, in 1201. Square in plan, it consisted of three stories. Its
exterior, like that of the façade, was decorated with arches, and was lighted
with windows ornamented with trefoils. It had two rows of battlements,
four corner-turrets, and a timber-work roof surmounted by a campanile,
above which rose a small spire. At the base of this campanile there were
four copper eagles, dating from 1330. At the foot of the belfry a door,
flanked by two pilasters, led to the inner court of the Hall. Over this door
was a modern statue of Nôtre-Dame-de-Tuine, with the Lion of Flanders
above.</p>

<p>The belfry served all the purposes of a Hôtel-de-Ville (previous to the
14th century there were no Hôtels-de-Ville properly so-called). It was there
that the representatives of the guilds held their meetings, and that the charters
of the guilds were kept in great coffers with manifold locks. There, also,
the archives of the town were stored. The bottom storey was used as a
prison. From the summit, unceasing watch was kept, to warn the citizens
of danger, especially that of fire.</p>

</div>

<p>The roof of the Hall was pitched very high, in order the more easily to
get rid of snow and rain water. It was gilded and emblazoned with the arms
of the city and those of the County of Flanders. This roof, with its dormer
windows, did not cover a stone vaulting, but a panelled ceiling. Inside the
upper storey were large wainscotted galleries, which, in the 19th century,
were divided by partitions and adorned with mural decorations.</p>

<h3>The Pauwels Room</h3>

<p>During the last century, the Hall was frequently restored and embellished.
In 1876 the walls of the eastern half of the southern building were decorated
with twelve mural paintings by Ferdinand Pauwels, representing the
principal events in the history of Ypres, in the days of its prosperity (1187
to the siege by the people of Ghent in 1383). The artist displayed exquisite
taste, especially in the fresco depicting the "Wedding of Mahaut de Béthune
with Mathias de Lorraine." The western half of the gallery was decorated
by the artist Delbecke, with paintings depicting the life of a cloth merchant.
Owing to the death of the artist, the last picture was never finished. This
gallery was used as a banqueting hall. A number of statues by Puyenbroeck
of Brussels, along the southern façade, had replaced the originals, badly
damaged during the Revolution (1793).</p>

<p>The River Yperlée formerly flowed past the western façade and, until
1848, there was a flight of steps with a double balustrade (17th century) to
facilitate the transfer of merchandise from the boats to the warehouses.</p>

<h3>The Nieuwerk</h3>

<p>The Nieuwerk did not detract from the imposing appearance of the
southern façade, of which it formed the continuation. Renaissance in style,
the plans are said to have been the work of J. Sporeman (about 1575). Building
was begun early in the 17th century and finished in 1624.</p>

<p>The ground-floor formed an open hall, 20 feet in width, the vaulting
of which was carried on slender cylindrical columns, joined by irregular
arcades. The building comprises two stories, the first of which communicated
with that of the Cloth Hall. The large high windows of the façades were
very close together. The roof was pierced with high and very ornamental
dormer-windows.</p>

<p>The Nieuwerk was restored about 1862. In the Chapelle Echevinale,
frescoes by Guffens and J. Swerts, and stained-glass was renovated, and at
the same time a fine fireplace was built by Malfait of Brussels. Old mural
paintings, representing St. Mark and St. John, and a frieze, depicting the Counts
of Flanders from 1322 to 1476, were discovered and restored. In the middle
of the hall stood a small equestrian statue of John of Brabant (1252&mdash;1294)
by A. Fiers.</p>

<p>This slightly-built Nieuwerk could not long withstand the bombardment.
The south gable, struck on November 21, 1914, collapsed, while on the
following day the Cloth Hall burst into flames. A few weeks' later the
Nieuwerk was completely destroyed.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Martin
(which became a cathedral
in 1559) replaced an older
church of the 11th century.
Built in the 13th century,
its choir dated from 1221,
and its nave from the second
half of that century. The
foundation-stone was laid by
Marguerite of Constantinople.
The western tower
dated only from the 15th
century, and replaced a tower
which had collapsed in 1433.
The new tower was 175 feet
in height, and was to have
been twice as high. Built
from the plans of Martin
Untenhove of Malines, it was
severe in style.</p>

<p>The plan of the Cathedral
was a Latin cross, and terminated
in a semicircular
choir. It underwent important
restorations during
the last century.</p>

<p>The façade of the south
arm of the transept was
of unusually great width.</p>

<p>The central portal was surrounded by a polygonal rose-window and crowned
with a high gable flanked by turrets. Above the side portals, the surface
of which was decorated with
arcading, were gables lighted by
rose-windows. This part of the
building was probably not earlier
than the 14th century.</p>

<p>There were no radial chapels
in this great church. A circulating
gallery running through the
buttresses formed an uninterrupted
passage around the building.</p>

<p>At the base of the roof ran
an open balustrade, broken at
intervals by the pinnacles which
crowned the buttresses.</p>

<p>Above the centre of the transept
rose a campanile, surmounted by a
very pointed timber-work spire.</p>

<p>The nave, and more especially
the choir, were remarkable. High
pillars with crocketed and foliate
capitals supported the springing
of the large irregular arches.
Above ran a circulating gallery or
triforium. The pointed arches of
the latter were carried by small
columns which originally rested on
the wide <i>abaci</i> of the capitals, but
several of them had been cut
away and replaced by statues of
apostles, evangelists, or persons
of note.</p>

<p>This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> arrangement is common
in Burgundy and, like others
to be found in the Cathedral&mdash;the
exterior circulating gallery,
the interior gallery, the form of
the latter, and various decorative
features&mdash;show how
strongly French, and especially
Burgundian influence
preponderated in Flanders
during the 14th century.</p>

<p>The choir was disfigured by
an ungraceful 16th century
altar. The stalls, carved about
1598 by C. Van Hoveke and
Urbain Taillebert, were noteworthy,
as was also the pulpit&mdash;a
richly decorated monumental
work, at the base of
which stood a life-size statue of
St. Dominic.</p>

<p>Urbain Taillebert was also

<p>Beside the tomb described above was
that of Jean Visscherius, Bishop of Ypres,
who died in 1613. The bishop, clothed in
his pontifical robes and wearing his mitre,
was represented in a recumbent position, his
head raised on a cushion and supported by
his hand (photo below).</p>

<p>There were other tombs in the church,
notably that of Louise Delage, Lady of
Saillort, widow of the Chancellor of Burgundy,
Hugonnet (beheaded in 1477).</p>

<p>In the pavement before the altar was the
third tombstone of the famous <i>Cornelius
Jansenius</i>. It was a simple slab of stone, on
which was carved a cross, and in the four
corners the figures 1, 6, 3, 8. Jansenius,
Bishop of Ypres, who died of plague on May 6, 1638, was the founder of the
sect of the Jansenists, which still exists in Holland, and whose headquarters
are at Utrecht. When and how this tombstone was placed there is not
known. It replaced two others removed by ecclesiastical authority in 1655
and 1673 respectively.</p>

boats were depicted. The canal
which passed before the house
has disappeared. The date of
construction was shown by
anchors fixed in the wall of the
second storey: 1-6-2-9. At the
top of the gable there was an
involuted niche which probably
sheltered the statue of the
patron-saint of sailors (photo

17th century.</p>

<p>This was an important, two-gabled building of symmetrical proportions.
The lower part of the façade resembled that of the Cloth Hall, but the upper
story and roof of the building were of a later date. The gables, with stair-like
copings, were decorated with blind windows. The lower storey
was of stone, while the gables and the upper part of the façade
were brick.</p>

<p>The first storey was
formerly occupied by the
Brotherhood of St. Michael.
The Museum, which was
housed there, contained a
number of pictures, interesting
drawings of the old
wooden fronts of the houses
of Ypres (by L. Boehm),
old chests containing the
Charters of the Drapers,
pieces of sculpture and
wrought ironwork.</p>

<p>Almost directly opposite
the Cloth Hall is the Rue de
Lille, in which, on the right,
is the <b>Hospice Belle</b> (photos,
p. 94).</p>

<p>This asylum for aged
women was founded about
1279 by Christine de Guines,
widow of Solomon Belle,
Lord of Boesinghe, and
rebuilt in the 17th century.
The façade of the chapel,
which faced the Rue de
Lille, contained twin doors,
surmounted by a large
stained-glass window set in a radiating flamboyant framework. In addition
to the statue of St. Nicholas (against the central mullion of the
stained-glass window), the lower part of this façade was embellished with
statues, in Renaissance niches, of the foundress and her husband. Above
the window was an <i>oculus</i>, the decoration of which was mingled with that
of an escutcheon immediately beneath it, on which the date "1616" could
still be deciphered.</p>

<p>Inside the chapel were a 17th
century portable confessional (a
very curious specimen of carved
woodwork), 15th century copper
candelabra, and a line picture
attributed to Melchior Broederlam.
This artist, whose works are very
rare, was a native of Ypres. He
preceded J. van Eyek as official
painter to the Dukes of Burgundy.
This picture was saved.</p>

<p>On the right of the street, in the
midst of the ruins, can be seen the
broken-in vaulting of the old French
Barrack (photo above), and on the
left, the <b>Hôtel Merghelynck</b>.</p>

<p>The latter charming 18th century
house stood at the corner of the
Rue des Fripiers. It was built (1774&mdash;1776)
from the plans of Thomas
Gombert of Lille, and its last proprietors
had converted it into an
interesting museum.</p>

<p>It was decorated with woodwork,
panelling, and Louis XVI. medallions
by Ant. Jos. de la Dicque.
The stucco ornamentation was the work of Grégoire Joseph Adam of
Valenciennes. The staircase balustrading was by Jacques Beernaert.</p>

<p>Inside, lofty columns supported the springing of the large irregular arches.
There was no vaulting, the church having a timber-work roof in shape of
an inverted keel. In it were a 16th century altar, large carved pulpit and
a fine choir-screen.</p>

<p>The latter fine house, with
double gables dated from the
16th century. The transition
from 15th to 16th century
style is very marked: on the
ground-floor is the irregular
arch of the 15th century,
while on the first floor the
arches are full semi-circles,
framing the rectangular
bays, whose tympana
are decorated with flamboyant figures. These tympana were added some
years later, thus giving the wide 17th century windows, of which the (French)
architect of the Hôtel Merghelynck made such happy use (photo, p. 101).</p>

of the château or of Bellewaarde Lake. It was here that the battles of July 31,
1917, were fought. On June 2, 1917, the first objectives of the British, in
their offensive for the clearing of Ypres, were the Wood and Village of Hooge.
They were only taken on July 31, although the château itself was captured
in June.</p>

<p>From Ypres to Vlamertinghe, the road runs through devastated country;
here numerous trenches and machine-gun shelters can still be seen.</p>

<p><i>Take the level-crossing over the Hazebrouck-Ypres railway, then cross
the Kemmelbeek by a bridge, still in good condition, and go through</i>
<b>Vlamertinghe</b>. This village suffered greatly from bombardments. In front
of the partly demolished church the road turns to the left.</p>

<p>From Vlamertinghe to Poperinghe the aspect of the country changes
completely. The road is shaded by large trees, and there are hop-fields on
both sides.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <b>Poperinghe</b> <i>by the Chaussée d'Ypres, continue by the Rue d'Ypres.

<h3>Poperinghe</h3>

<p>Poperinghe, a small town of 12,000 inhabitants, is the centre of an
agricultural district, where hop-growing is the chief industry.</p>

<p>Of its three churches, two only are interesting from an artistic point of
view.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Jean is Romanesque in style, whilst that of St. Bertin
contains some remarkable woodwork: the Vérité pulpit, the Dean's confessional,
and the roof-loft are masterpieces of the Renaissance period.</p>

<p>In the court of the Hôtel Skindles there is a tombstone dating from 1171.</p>

<p>Old houses are rare in Poperinghe, the town having several times been
destroyed during its history.</p>

still be seen along the road. <i>Cross a narrow-gauge railway</i>, which serves a
military station on the right.</p>

<p><i>The road is first undulating, then descends to</i> <b>Reninghelst</b>. <i>Here
leave on the left the church</i>, which has not greatly suffered. In the churchyard
near by, there are a few French soldiers' graves. <i>At the cross-roads, turn to
the left, then 200 yards further on, at</i> <b>Zevecoten</b>, take the road on the right
to <b>La Clytte</b>.</p>

<p>The further we advance the greater the devastation of the ground becomes.</p>

<p><i>At the first houses of Clytte Hamlet, turn to the right.</i> The German
rush of 1918 was broken before this village.</p>

<p>After the capture of Kemmel Hill, a violent enemy attack on April 27
broke down before the desperate resistance of the French 28th Infantry
Division (Madelin) and the British 9th Infantry Division.</p>

<p><b>Kemmel</b> is seen on the left, and <b>Scherpenberg</b> in front.</p>

<p><i>Pass the church</i> (photo, p. 111). <i>The road turns to the right beyond the
last houses, and gradually climbs the slopes of</i> <b>Scherpenberg</b> (altitude,
340 feet). The side of this hill is almost perpendicular, and in it are
numerous remains of shelters.</p>

<p>The narrow road which led to the top was completely destroyed. The
ascent can, however, be made on foot.</p>

<p>In spite of all their efforts, the Germans failed to reach Scherpenberg in
their offensive of 1918. Their efforts to outflank the Flanders Hills on the
north broke down before the resistance of the French 39th Infantry Division
(Massenet) on April 26, 27 and 28, 1918.</p>

<p><i>At the next fork turn to the right into the village of</i> <b>Westoutre</b>.
Here the road winds through the valley. The river on the left has, owing to

<p>Locre was the scene of terrific fighting during the German offensive
against the Flanders Hills in 1918. On April 19, 1918, it was taken by the
enemy after a daring advance by their Alpine Corps, which had succeeded in
reaching Kemmelbeek Valley. On the same day, the soldiers of this picked
corps continued their advance as far as the crossing with the Westoutre road,
1 kilomètre to the north of Locre; but here the French dragoons, in an irresistible
counter-attack, drove the Germans back and recaptured Locre,
leaving only the <i>Hospice</i>, to the south-east of the village, in enemy hands.</p>

turn to the left; then at the next fork, leaving some French graves on the
left, take the road on the right leading to</i> <b>Kemmel Hill</b>.</p>

<p>This hill, the first of the Hills of Flanders, is famous for the battles fought
there in 1918. On April 17, 1918, the Germans had reached the foot. On
the 25th, they rushed to the attack, encircling and capturing the hill, which
was held by the French 30th Infantry Regiment. During the next and following
days French counter-attacks failed to dislodge the enemy. It was only
on August 30 that the Germans evacuated the hill; on the 31st it was occupied
by the British.</p>

<p><i>Pass Burgrave Farm. At the foot of the hill (inaccessible to vehicles)
the road turns to the left.</i> Here the ground is completely churned up, the
bits of road being connected up by little bridges thrown across the shell-holes.
In the distance is seen the ruined church of Kemmel (photo, p. 113).
<i>On reaching the village, turn to the right, to visit the ruins of the château</i>
(photo, p. 114), <i>then return to the fork and take the road on the right</i>.</p>

<p>The road is hilly, as the photograph, taken 500 yards this side of the
crossing with the La Clytte road, shows. <i>Keeping straight along the road
by which he came, as far as Zevecoten, the tourist then returns first to the
left and then to the right.</i></p>

<b>Poperinghe</b>. <i>Cross the river. At the crossing of the road from Poperinghe
to Boeschèpe, turn to the left to visit the largest cemetery in this region</i>
(shown on the Itinerary, p. 108), which contains 20,000 to 22,000 graves
The photograph gives but a slight idea of the size of it.</p>

asylum on the left.</i> The French custom-house is in the Rue d'Ypres. (In
June, 1919, there was as yet no corresponding office at Locre in Belgium.)</p>

<p>Bailleul suffered terribly from the bombardments, most of the houses
being destroyed.</p>

<p>Bailleul was taken by three German divisions on April 15, 1918, as well
as Little Hill and the Ravelsberg, to the west of the town. But the next
day the German forces, who had orders to consolidate their success and
turn the chain of hills from the south, were rudely checked by French
divisions, rushed up to relieve their British comrades, and in three days,
thanks to the prompt and vigorous action of General Pétain, they were driven
back.</p>

<p><i>Have a look round the Grande Place before taking the Rue de Lille</i>
(N. 42) <i>on the left</i>. <i>At the Noveau-Monde cross-roads</i>, where there is an
important munitions depôt with railway-station, <i>turn sharply to the left,
leaving Lille Hill on the left</i>.</p>

<p><i>After twice crossing the railway</i> (<i>l. c.</i>) the Customs Barracks are passed.
The road passes over three more level-crossings, skirts the frontier, crosses
the railway, and then the Stilbecque stream. <i>Next pass through</i> <b>Nieppe</b>
village&mdash;almost entirely demolished; <i>then over the railway</i> (<i>l. c.</i>). <i>Cross
the Lys by the Nieppe Bridge and enter</i> <b>Armentières</b>, <i>via the Rue de

latter to the right, and cross the railway</i> (<i>l. c.</i>).</p>

<p>For particulars concerning Armentières, see pp. 49&mdash;55, first Itinerary.</p>

<p>Contrarily to other forests in the battle area, Nieppe Forest did not suffer
greatly, although, like the others, it concealed munitions and stores. (Note
the numerous narrow-gauge rails lying along the roadside.)</p>

<p>The roads themselves bear traces of hastily constructed defence-works.</p>

<p>On the left, near the outskirts of the forest, a pathway leads to a cemetery
containing British soldiers' graves.</p>

<p>La Motte-au-Bois, lying in a clearing, suffered little. Its 17th century
château, which escaped destruction, can be reached by crossing the canal
over a temporary bridge, leaving on the right a small octagonal chapel of
no special interest.</p>

<p><i>Return by the same road to</i> <b>Merville</b>, <i>and pass through it</i>, taking a
glance at the ruins of the church on the right. <i>Cross the canal, the Lys,
and the railway near the station, and turn to the left immediately afterwards.</i></p>

<p><i>Follow the railway, then re-cross it. The road here runs parallel to the
canal. At the next fork leave on the left the road to the Gorgue; turn to
the right, cross the railway, and enter</i> <b>Lestrem</b>. <i>Beyond the bridge over
the Lawe, pass the church, then turn to the right, and skirt the grounds of
an old ruined château.</i></p>

<p>This château&mdash;completely restored in 1890&mdash;was used by the Germans
as an observation-post, and subsequently blown up by them on April 10, 1918
(photo, p. 122).</p>

<p>On leaving Lestrem the road winds. On the left, broken fragments of
ironwork mark the site of the distillery, which provided a livelihood for part
of the working population of <b>La Fosse</b> village. The ruined church is seen
to the left, on the far side of the canal.</p>

<p>Lawe Canal, after running parallel to the road, turns and cuts it. <i>Cross
the canal by the temporary bridge.</i></p>

<p>A little further on, the road again follows the canal as far as the entrance
to <b>Béthune</b>.</p>

<p><i>Cross the Aires Canal, pass the railway station on the left, then through
the horse-market to the Place de la République. Cross the latter and take
the Rue de Rivage to the Grande Place.</i></p>

<p>For four years the whole district just passed through, since leaving
Armentières, was the scene of incessant fighting.</p>

<p>In October, 1914, it saw the close of the fighting which concluded the
"race to the sea," and the stabilising of the front here resulted in more than
six months' continuous fighting.</p>

<p>A little later, the Artois offensive of 1915 found an echo in local operations
for the possession of key positions like Festubert and Neuve-Chapelle, giving
rise to sanguinary struggles without decisive result for either side.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1918, it was the scene of the third great German offensive for
the conquest of the Hills (see pp. 38&mdash;43.)</p>


<h3>Béthune</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The foundation in 984 of the Collegiate Church of St. Bartholomew, by
Robert I., ancestor of Sully, is the first mention of Béthune in history. The
town, owned in turn by the Counts of Flanders, the Dukes of Burgundy, and the
House of Austria, annexed to France at the Peace of Nimègue in 1678, taken
in 1710 by the Triple Alliance, was finally restored to France in 1713 by
the Treaty of Utrecht.</p>

<p>A fraternity, called the "Confrérie des Charitables," still survives.
Founded after the plague of 1188 by two blacksmiths, to whom St. Eloi
appeared in a vision, asking them to assist their fellow-countrymen who
were dying unsuccoured, it performed the burial rites of the dead.</p>

<p>During the Great War the town was intermittently bombarded for three
and a half years, but from the end of February, 1918, to April 21 the violence
of the shelling increased tenfold, and on the latter date the civil population
had to be evacuated, the battle having carried the German lines within two
miles of Béthune.</p>

<span class="caption">BÉTHUNE, from an old engraving</span>
</div>

<p>On April 13&mdash;18 the bombardment became so intense that the town was
almost razed to the ground.</p>

<p>The officials and the miners of the district were mentioned in Orders of
the Day for their courage and endurance.</p>

<p>At first sight, the town does not seem to have suffered so much, but this
impression soon passes.</p>

<p>The Grande Place (photo, p. 126) where the chief beauties of this small
town were concentrated, is now a heap of bricks and stones.</p>

<p>The old houses have fallen in; only the façade of one of them (No. 44),
dating from the 16th century, remains, and even this one was severely
damaged and is now supported by wooden props.</p>

<p>Of the modern Hôtel-de-Ville there remains only a small portion of the
façade (photo, p. 127), whilst the Savings Bank on the left is a shapeless ruin.</p>

<p>The belfry, built in 1346 and restored forty years later, is still standing,
but the upper portion of it has disappeared, and the houses which surrounded
it have fallen in.</p>

<p>This spire contained a peal of bells, one of which, dated 1576, was called
"La Joyeuse."</p>

<p>"La Joyeuse" is silenced for ever.</p>

<p>This peal gave its name to the street behind the belfry, which leads to
the Church of St. Waast (1533&mdash;1545), whose massive tower was more than
half-a-century later than the rest of the building.</p>

<p><i>To leave the town, return from the Grande Place to the Place de la
République</i> (in June, 1917, it was impossible to take the Rue d'Arras, which
is the direct road, all this part of the town being obstructed by ruins).</p>

<p>For four years the fighting never ceased in this region. <i>Leave the Festubert
sector on the right.</i> Throughout the struggle, the Canadians fought so bravely
that one of their recruiting posters was dedicated to the heroes of Festubert,
with this inscription:</p>

<p>
"Oui, vous avez raison, c'est hideux le carnage,<br />
Oui, le progrès blessé recule et se débat,<br />
Notre siècle en fureur retourne au moyen âge,<br />
Mais sachons donc nous battre, au moins, puisqu'on se bat."<br />
</p>

<p><i>At the crossing of N. 41 and 43 leave the latter on the right.</i></p>

<p><i>Cross the Grande Rue d'Annequin.</i> From here, on the right, coalpit
No. 9 can be seen, with its wrecked machinery in the air&mdash;a mass of twisted
ironwork.</p>

<p><i>The ruined village of</i> <b>Cambrin</b> <i>is next passed through. On the other side
of the level-crossing, leave on the right the badly damaged village of</i> <b>Auchy-lez-La-Bassée</b>.
<i>The road now follows the canal.</i> After crossing the railway
(l. c.) vast heaps of broken railway trucks smashed by the shells can be seen
in the fields on the right. Further on are eight or nine blockhouses which
were formerly brick-kilns. <i>Turn to the left, cross the railway, then the
Aire Canal by the new suspension bridge</i> (beside the old one shown in the
photograph) <i>and enter</i> <b>La Bassée</b>, <i>now a heap of ruins</i>.</p>

<p>La Bassée, an important centre standing at the junction of several roads
and railways, in the heart of the plain of Flanders, south-west of Lille, was
the objective of many desperate struggles during the war.</p>

<p>In October, 1914, the district of La Bassée was the scene of endless conflicts
between the Allied and enemy cavalry forces, the little town finally
remaining in the hands of the Germans.</p>

<p>A year later, the British offensive in Artois drove back the Germans south
of La Bassée, whilst to the north the positions of Neuve-Chapelle and Aubers
were bitterly disputed. However, the lines shifted but little, and La Bassée
still remained in the centre of the line of fire.</p>

<p>During the German offensive of 1918, the town again came inside the
German lines, but the enemy were driven out shortly afterwards, during the
Allied offensive that led to the Armistice and to the consummation of victory.</p>

<p><i>Go through the Rue d'Estaires</i>, in which there is a large and very high
armoured shelter that served as an observation-post. <i>Pass the ruined church</i>
(photo, p. 132), <i>then turn to the right into the Grande Place</i>. Inside a three-storied
house, which later collapsed under the shell-fire (photo, p. 132), there
was a German observation-post of concrete, armed with machine-guns.</p>

<p><i>On leaving La Bassée continue along N. 41</i>, with its fine trees cut down
and left along the sides of the road. <i>Pass the first houses of</i> <b>Illies</b> <i>village,
on the left, and 100 yards further on, cross a large avenue</i> (<i>leading to the
Château de Varneton</i>).</p>

<p>On the right, and connected with <i>N. 41</i> by a small bridge, there is a large
German cemetery with a monument to the memory of the soldiers of the
XVth Regiment (Prinz Friedrich) (photo, p. 133).</p>

<p><i>The road leads to</i> <b>Fournes</b>, <i>the outskirts of which are crossed by Rue
Pasteur</i>. Pass an avenue of fine trees leading to the Château of Comte
d'Hespel, accidentally burned down.</p>

<p>At the cross-roads there is a bandstand erected by the Germans. A crude
painting on the back of the stand represents a tug-of-war between a German
and British, French and American soldiers, in which the German wins apparently
with ease. Italy, depicted as a monkey, is seen clinging to the rope.</p>

<p>After turning to the right the road passes the large Gambert Boarding
School, which was severely damaged. Behind it is a large cemetery.</p>

<p><i>Follow the road to the badly damaged village of</i> <b>Beaucamps</b>, where there
are numerous concrete shelters in the houses. <i>At the cross-roads turn to
the left.</i> A wayside-cross, ten yards further on, indicate the road. A short
distance further on are the ruins of the Château de Flandre, the basement
of which, in reinforced concrete, was used as a machine-gun emplacement.</p>

<p>Haubourdin suffered comparatively little from the shells, but like all the
other occupied towns of France, it was subjected to exactions, war-levies,
deportations and pillage. The German soldiers, when relieved from the
Hindenburg line, had their rest-billets there. The church (of no especial
interest), the hospital (15th century), and a chapel built in 1347, are still
preserved.</p>

When the Great War broke out, Michelin at once converted
an immense new four-storied warehouse into an up-to-date
Hospital, with Operating Theatre, X-Ray, Bacteriological
Laboratory, etc. Seven weeks later (September 22, 1914)
Doctors, Dispensers, Nurses, Sisters of Mercy, and auxiliaries
were all at their posts. The first wounded arrived the same
night. In all, 2,993 wounded were received.</p>

<p>All expenses were paid by Michelin.</p>

<p>The story of how Michelin did "his bit" during the war
is told briefly and simply in the illustrated booklet, "The
Michelin Hospital," sent post free on application.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
